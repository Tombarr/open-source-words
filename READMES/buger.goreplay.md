## About

GoReplay is the simplest and safest way to test your app using real traffic before you put it into production.

As your application grows, the effort required to test it also grows exponentially. GoReplay offers you the simple idea of reusing your existing traffic for testing, which makes it incredibly powerful. Our state of art technique allows you to analyze and record your application traffic without affecting it. This eliminates the risks that come with putting a third party component in the critical path. 

GoReplay increases your confidence in code deployments, configuration changes and infrastructure changes. Did we mention that no coding is required?



Here is basic workflow: The listener server catches http traffic and sends it to the replay server or saves to file. The replay server forwards traffic to a given address.

## Installation
Download latest binary from https://github.com/buger/goreplay/releases or [compile by yourself](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Compilation).

## Getting started

The most basic setup will be `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-stdout` which acts like tcpdump.
If you already have test environment you can start replaying: `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-http http://staging.env`.
