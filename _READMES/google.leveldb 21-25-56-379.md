leveldb is a fast key value storage library written at google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values authors sanjay ghemawat sanjay google com and jeff dean jeff google com features keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays data is stored sorted by key callers can provide a custom comparison function to override the sort order the basic operations are put key value get key delete key multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of data forward and backward iteration is supported over the data data is automatically compressed using the snappy compression library external activity file system operations etc is relayed through a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system interactions documentation leveldb library documentation is online and bundled with the source code limitations this is not a sql database it does not have a relational data model it does not support sql queries and it has no support for indexes only a single process possibly multi threaded can access a particular database at a time there is no client server support builtin to the library an application that needs such support will have to wrap their own server around the library building this project supports cmake out of the box quick start bash mkdir p build cd build cmake dcmake build type release cmake build please see the cmake documentation and cmakelists txt for more advanced usage contributing to the leveldb project the leveldb project welcomes contributions leveldbs primary goal is to be a reliable and fast key value store changes that are in line with the features limitations outlined above and meet the requirements below will be considered contribution requirements posix only we generally will only accept changes that are both compiled and tested on a posix platform usually linux very small changes will sometimes be accepted but consider that more of an exception than the rule stable api we strive very hard to maintain a stable api changes that require changes for projects using leveldb might be rejected without sufficient benefit to the project tests all changes must be accompanied by a new or changed test or a sufficient explanation as to why a new or changed test is not required submitting a pull request before any pull request will be accepted the author must first sign a contributor license agreement cla at https cla developers google com in order to keep the commit timeline linear squash your changes down to a single commit and rebase on google leveldb master this keeps the commit timeline linear and more easily synced with the internal repository at google more information at githubs about git rebase page performance here is a performance report with explanations from the run of the included db bench program the results are somewhat noisy but should be enough to get a ballpark performance estimate setup we use a database with a million entries each entry has a 16 byte key and a 100 byte value values used by the benchmark compress to about half their original size leveldb version 1 1 date sun may 1 12 11 26 2011 cpu 4 x intel r core tm 2 quad cpu q6600 2 40ghz cpucache 4096 kb keys 16 bytes each values 100 bytes each 50 bytes after compression entries 1000000 raw size 110 6 mb estimated file size 62 9 mb estimated write performance the fill benchmarks create a brand new database in either sequential or random order the fillsync benchmark flushes data from the operating system to the disk after every operation the other write operations leave the data sitting in the operating system buffer cache for a while the overwrite benchmark does random writes that update existing keys in the database fillseq 1 765 micros op 62 7 mb s fillsync 268 409 micros op 0 4 mb s 10000 ops fillrandom 2 460 micros op 45 0 mb s overwrite 2 380 micros op 46 5 mb s each op above corresponds to a write of a single key value pair i e a random write benchmark goes at approximately 400 000 writes per second each fillsync operation costs much less 0 3 millisecond than a disk seek typically 10 milliseconds we suspect that this is because the hard disk itself is buffering the update in its memory and responding before the data has been written to the platter this may or may not be safe based on whether or not the hard disk has enough power to save its memory in the event of a power failure read performance we list the performance of reading sequentially in both the forward and reverse direction and also the performance of a random lookup note that the database created by the benchmark is quite small therefore the report characterizes the performance of leveldb when the working set fits in memory the cost of reading a piece of data that is not present in the operating system buffer cache will be dominated by the one or two disk seeks needed to fetch the data from disk write performance will be mostly unaffected by whether or not the working set fits in memory readrandom 16 677 micros op approximately 60 000 reads per second readseq 0 476 micros op 232 3 mb s readreverse 0 724 micros op 152 9 mb s leveldb compacts its underlying storage data in the background to improve read performance the results listed above were done immediately after a lot of random writes the results after compactions which are usually triggered automatically are better readrandom 11 602 micros op approximately 85 000 reads per second readseq 0 423 micros op 261 8 mb s readreverse 0 663 micros op 166 9 mb s some of the high cost of reads comes from repeated decompression of blocks read from disk if we supply enough cache to the leveldb so it can hold the uncompressed blocks in memory the read performance improves again readrandom 9 775 micros op approximately 100 000 reads per second before compaction readrandom 5 215 micros op approximately 190 000 reads per second after compaction repository contents see doc index md for more explanation see doc impl md for a brief overview of the implementation the public interface is in include h callers should not include or rely on the details of any other header files in this package those internal apis may be changed without warning guide to header files include db h main interface to the db start here include options h control over the behavior of an entire database and also control over the behavior of individual reads and writes include comparator h abstraction for user specified comparison function if you want just bytewise comparison of keys you can use the default comparator but clients can write their own comparator implementations if they want custom ordering e g to handle different character encodings etc include iterator h interface for iterating over data you can get an iterator from a db object include write batch h interface for atomically applying multiple updates to a database include slice h a simple module for maintaining a pointer and a length into some other byte array include status h status is returned from many of the public interfaces and is used to report success and various kinds of errors include env h abstraction of the os environment a posix implementation of this interface is in util env posix cc include table h include table builder h lower level modules that most clients probably wont use directly
