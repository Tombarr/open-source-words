lighthouse lighthouse analyzes web apps and web pages collecting modern performance metrics and insights on developer best practices using lighthouse in chrome devtools lighthouse is integrated directly into the chrome developer tools under the audits panel installation install chrome run it open chrome devtools select the audits panel and hit run audits using the chrome extension installation install the extension from the chrome web store run it follow the extension quick start guide using the node cli lighthouse requires node 8 lts 8 9 or later installation sh npm install g lighthouse or use yarn yarn global add lighthouse run it lighthouse https airhorner com by default lighthouse writes the report to an html file you can control the output format by passing flags cli options sh lighthouse help lighthouse logging verbose displays verbose logging boolean quiet displays no progress debug logs or errors boolean configuration save assets save the trace contents screenshots to disk boolean list all audits prints a list of all available audits and exits boolean list trace categories prints a list of all required trace categories and exits boolean additional

is considered done loading and the run should continue warning very high values can lead to large traces and instability default 45000 enable error reporting enables error reporting overriding any

run will quit early boolean audit mode a process saved artifacts from disk boolean output output reporter for the results supports multiple values choices csv json html default html output path the file path to output the results use stdout to write to stdout if using json or csv output default is stdout if using html output default is a file in the working directory with a name based on the

launches browser collects artifacts saves them to disk in latest run and quits lighthouse http example com a skips browser interaction loads artifacts from disk in latest run runs audits on them generates report lighthouse http example com ga normal gather audit run but also saves collected artifacts to disk for subsequent a runs you can optionally provide a custom folder destination to g a ga without a value the default will be pwd latest run lighthouse ga gmailartifacts https gmail com notes on error reporting the first time you run the cli you will be prompted with a message asking you if lighthouse can anonymously report runtime exceptions the lighthouse team uses this information to detect new bugs and avoid regressions opting out will not affect your ability to use lighthouse in any way learn more viewing a report lighthouse can produce a report as json or html html report online viewer running lighthouse with the output json flag generates a json dump of the run you can view this report online by visiting https googlechrome github io lighthouse viewer and dragging the file onto the app you can also use the export button from the top of any lighthouse html report and open the report in the lighthouse viewer in the viewer reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top right corner and signing in to github note shared reports are stashed as a secret

scores satisfy your custom thresholds faq how does lighthouse work see lighthouse architecture can i configure the lighthouse run yes details in lighthouse configuration how does lighthouse use network throttling and how can i make it better good question network and cpu throttling are applied by default in a lighthouse run the network attempts to emulate 3g and the cpu is slowed down 4x from your machines default speed if you prefer to run lighthouse without throttling youll have to use the cli and disable it with the throttling flags mentioned above read more in our guide to network throttling are results sent to a remote server nope lighthouse runs locally auditing a page using a local version of the chrome browser installed the machine report results are never processed or beaconed to a remote server how do i author custom audits to extend lighthouse tip see lighthouse architecture for more information on terminology and architecture lighthouse can be extended to run custom audits and gatherers that you author this is great if youre already tracking performance metrics in your site and want to surface those metrics within a lighthouse report if youre interested in running your own custom audits check out our custom audit example over in recipes how do i contribute wed love help writing audits fixing bugs and making the tool more useful see contributing to get
