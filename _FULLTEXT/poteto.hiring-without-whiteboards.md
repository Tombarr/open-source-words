Hiring Without Whiteboards A listing of companies (or teams) that dont do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a symbol for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode probably fall into a similar category. The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work – for example pairing on a real world problem, or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) our recommendations for ways to conduct better interviews. tl;dr Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍 Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎 Please open a PR to be added. Duds If youve been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a PR to remove them from this list. I want to sort/filter/group by X! Alphabetical Geographical Keywords Remote only Additions to this document that are properly formatted will automatically be pushed and added to the Airtable.
