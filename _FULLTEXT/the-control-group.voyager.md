Installation Steps 1. Require the Package After creating your new Laravel application you can include the Voyager package with the following command: bash composer require tcg/voyager 2. Add the DB Credentials & APP_URL Next make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file: DB_HOST=localhost DB_DATABASE=homestead DB_USERNAME=homestead DB_PASSWORD=secret You will also want to update your website URL inside of the APP_URL variable inside the .env file: APP_URL=http://localhost:8000 Only if you are on Laravel 5.4 will you need to Add the Service Provider. 3. Run The Installer Lastly, we can install voyager. You can do this either with or without dummy data. The dummy data will include 1 admin account (if no users already exists), 1 demo page, 4 demo posts, 2 categories and 7 settings. To install Voyager without dummy simply run bash php artisan voyager:install If you prefer installing it with dummy run bash php artisan voyager:install --with-dummy Troubleshooting: Specified key was too long error. If you see this error message you have an outdated version of MySQL, use the following solution: https://laravel-news.com/laravel-5-4-key-too-long-error And were all good to go! Start up a local development server with php artisan serve And, visit http://localhost:8000/admin. Creating an Admin User If you did go ahead with the dummy data, a user should have been created for you with the following login credentials: email: admin@admin.com password: password NOTE: Please note that a dummy user is only created if there are no current users in your database. If you did not go with the dummy user, you may wish to assign admin privileges to an existing user. This can easily be done by running this command: bash php artisan voyager:admin your@email.com If you did not install the dummy data and you wish to create a new admin user you can pass the --create flag, like so: bash php artisan voyager:admin your@email.com --create And you will be prompted for the users name and password.
