.htaccess Snippets A collection of useful .htaccess snippets, all in one place. NOTE: .htaccess files are for people that do not have rights to edit the main server configuration file. They are intrinsically slower and more complicated than using the main config. Please see the howto in the httpd documentation for further details. Disclaimer: While dropping the snippet into an .htaccess file is most of the time sufficient, there are cases when certain modifications might be required. Use at your own risk. IMPORTANT: Apache 2.4 introduces a few breaking changes, most notably in access control configuration. For more information, check the upgrading document as well as this issue. Credits What we are doing here is mostly collecting useful snippets from all over the interwebs (for example, a good chunk is from Apache Server Configs) into one place. While weve been trying to credit where due, things might be missing. If you believe anything here is your work and credits should be given, let us know, or just send a PR.

Force www apacheconf RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example\.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC] Force www in a Generic Way apacheconf RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC] RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)| RewriteRule ^ http%1://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L] This works for any domain. Source Force non-www Its still open for debate whether www or non-www is the way to go, so if you happen to be a fan of bare domains, here you go: apacheconf RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301] Force non-www in a Generic Way apacheconf RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\. RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)|off RewriteCond http%1://%{HTTP_HOST} ^(https?://)(www\.)?(.+)$ RewriteRule ^ %1%3%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L] Force HTTPS ``` apacheconf RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} Note: Its also recommended to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on your HTTPS website to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security # Remove "includeSubDomains" if you dont want to enforce HSTS on all subdomains Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;includeSubDomains" ``` Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy Useful if you have a proxy in front of your server performing TLS termination. apacheconf RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} Force Trailing Slash apacheconf RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /+[^\.]+$ RewriteRule ^(.+[^/])$ %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L] Remove Trailing Slash This snippet will redirect paths ending in slashes to their non-slash-terminated counterparts (except for actual directories), e.g. http://www.example.com/blog/ to http://www.example.com/blog. This is important for SEO, since its recommended to have a canonical URL for every page. apacheconf RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$ RewriteRule ^ %1 [R=301,L] Source Redirect a Single Page apacheconf Redirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html Redirect 301 /oldpage2.html http://www.example.com/folder/ Source Redirect Using RedirectMatch apacheconf RedirectMatch 301 /subdirectory(.*) http://www.newsite.com/newfolder/$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).htm$ /$1.html RedirectMatch 301 ^/200([0-9])/([^01])(.*)$ /$2$3 RedirectMatch 301 ^/category/(.*)$ /$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*)/htaccesselite-ultimate-htaccess-article.html(.*) /htaccess/htaccess.html RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).html/1/(.*) /$1.html$2 RedirectMatch 301 ^/manual/(.*)$ http://www.php.net/manual/$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/dreamweaver/(.*)$ /tools/$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/z/(.*)$ http://static.askapache.com/$1 Source Alias a Single Directory apacheconf RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^source-directory/(.*) /target-directory/$1 [R=301,L] Alias Paths to Script apacheconf FallbackResource /index.fcgi This example has an index.fcgi file in some directory, and any requests within that directory that fail to resolve a filename/directory will be sent to the index.fcgi script. Its good if you want baz.foo/some/cool/path to be handled by baz.foo/index.fcgi (which also supports requests to baz.foo) while maintaining baz.foo/css/style.css and the like. Get access to the original path from the PATH_INFO environment variable, as exposed to your scripting environment. apacheconf RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^$ index.fcgi/ [QSA,L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L] This is a less efficient version of the FallbackResource directive (because using mod_rewrite is more complex than just handling the FallbackResource directive), but its also more flexible. Redirect an Entire Site apacheconf Redirect 301 / http://newsite.com/ This way does it with links intact. That is www.oldsite.com/some/crazy/link.html will become www.newsite.com/some/crazy/link.html. This is extremely helpful when you are just “moving” a site to a new domain. Source Alias “Clean” URLs This snippet lets you use “clean” URLs -- those without a PHP extension, e.g. example.com/users instead of example.com/users.php. apacheconf RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L] Source Security Deny All Access ``` apacheconf Apache 2.2 Deny from all Apache 2.4 Require all denied ``` But wait, this will lock you out from your content as well! Thus introducing... Deny All Access Except Yours ``` apacheconf Apache 2.2 Order deny,allow Deny from all Allow from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Apache 2.4 Require all denied Require ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ``xxx.xxx.xxx.xxxis your IP. If you replace the last three digits with0/12` for example, this will specify a range of IPs within the same network, thus saving you the trouble to list all allowed IPs separately. Source Now of course theres a reversed version: Allow All Access Except Spammers ``` apacheconf Apache 2.2 Order deny,allow Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxy Apache 2.4 Require all granted Require not ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Require not ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxy ``` Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories Hidden files and directories (those whose names start with a dot .) should most, if not all, of the time be secured. For example: .htaccess, .htpasswd, .git, .hg... apacheconf RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -d [OR] RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -f RewriteRule "(^|/)\." - [F] Alternatively, you can just raise a “Not Found” error, giving the attacker no clue: apacheconf RedirectMatch 404 /\..*$ Deny Access to Backup and Source Files These files may be left by some text/HTML editors (like Vi/Vim) and pose a great security danger if exposed to public. ``` apacheconf ## Apache 2.2 Order allow,deny Deny from all Satisfy All ## Apache 2.4 # Require all denied ``` Source Disable Directory Browsing apacheconf Options All -Indexes Disable Image Hotlinking ``` apacheconf RewriteEngine on Remove the following line if you want to block blank referrer too RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(.+.)?example.com [NC] RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp)$ - [NC,F,L] If you want to display a “blocked” banner in place of the hotlinked image, replace the above rule with: RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp) http://example.com/blocked.png [R,L] ``` Disable Image Hotlinking for Specific Domains Sometimes you want to disable image hotlinking from some bad guys only. ``` apacheconf RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^https?://(.+.)?badsite.com [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^https?://(.+.)?badsite2.com [NC,OR] RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp)$ - [NC,F,L] If you want to display a “blocked” banner in place of the hotlinked image, replace the above rule with: RewriteRule .(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp) http://example.com/blocked.png [R,L] ``` Password Protect a Directory First you need to create a .htpasswd file somewhere in the system: bash htpasswd -c /home/fellowship/.htpasswd boromir Then you can use it for authentication: apacheconf AuthType Basic AuthName "One does not simply" AuthUserFile /home/fellowship/.htpasswd Require valid-user Password Protect a File or Several Files ``` apacheconf AuthName "One still does not simply" AuthType Basic AuthUserFile /home/fellowship/.htpasswd Require valid-user Require valid-user ``` Block Visitors by Referrer This denies access for all users who are coming from (referred by) a specific domain. Source ``` apacheconf RewriteEngine on Options +FollowSymlinks RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} somedomain.com [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} anotherdomain.com RewriteRule .* - [F] ``` Prevent Framing the Site This prevents the website to be framed (i.e. put into an iframe tag), when still allows framing for a specific URI. apacheconf SetEnvIf Request_URI "/starry-night" allow_framing=true Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN env=!allow_framing Performance Compress Text Files ``` apacheconf # Force compression for mangled headers. # https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/pushing-beyond-gzipping-25601.html <IfModule mod_setenvif.c> <IfModule mod_headers.c> SetEnvIfNoCase ^(Accept-EncodXng|X-cept-Encoding|X{15}|~{15}|-{15})$ ^((gzip|deflate)\s*,?\s*)+|[X~-]{4,13}$ HAVE_Accept-Encoding RequestHeader append Accept-Encoding "gzip,deflate" env=HAVE_Accept-Encoding </IfModule> </IfModule> # Compress all output labeled with one of the following MIME-types # (for Apache versions below 2.3.7, you dont need to enable `mod_filter` # and can remove the `<IfModule mod_filter.c>` and `</IfModule>` lines # as `AddOutputFilterByType` is still in the core directives). <IfModule mod_filter.c> AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/atom+xml \ application/javascript \ application/json \ application/rss+xml \ application/vnd.ms-fontobject \ application/x-font-ttf \ application/x-web-app-manifest+json \ application/xhtml+xml \ application/xml \ font/opentype \ image/svg+xml \ image/x-icon \ text/css \ text/html \ text/plain \ text/x-component \ text/xml </IfModule> ``` Source Set Expires Headers Expires headers tell the browser whether they should request a specific file from the server or just grab it from the cache. It is advisable to set static contents expires headers to something far in the future. If you dont control versioning with filename-based cache busting, consider lowering the cache time for resources like CSS and JS to something like 1 week. Source ``` apacheconf ExpiresActive on ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 month" # CSS ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year" # Data interchange ExpiresByType application/json "access plus 0 seconds" ExpiresByType application/xml "access plus 0 seconds" ExpiresByType text/xml "access plus 0 seconds" # Favicon (cannot be renamed!)

Source apacheconf <IfModule mod_headers.c> Header unset ETag </IfModule> FileETag None Miscellaneous Set PHP Variables ``` apacheconf php_value For example: php_value upload_max_filesize 50M php_value max_execution_time 240 ``` Custom Error Pages apacheconf ErrorDocument 500 "Houston, we have a problem." ErrorDocument 401 http://error.example.com/mordor.html ErrorDocument 404 /errors/halflife3.html Force Downloading Sometimes you want to force the browser to download some content instead of displaying it. apacheconf <Files *.md> ForceType application/octet-stream Header set Content-Disposition attachment </Files> Now there is a yang to this yin: Prevent Downloading Sometimes you want to force the browser to display some content instead of downloading it. apacheconf <FilesMatch "\.(tex|log|aux)$"> Header set Content-Type text/plain </FilesMatch> Allow Cross-Domain Fonts CDN-served webfonts might not work in Firefox or IE due to CORS.

The following snippet should switch the PHP version for you. ``` apacheconf AddHandler application/x-httpd-php56 .php Alternatively, you can use AddType AddType application/x-httpd-php56 .php ``` Disable Internet Explorer Compatibility View Compatibility View in IE may affect how some websites are displayed. The following snippet should force IE to use the Edge Rendering Engine and disable the Compatibility View. apacheconf <IfModule mod_headers.c> BrowserMatch MSIE is-msie Header set X-UA-Compatible IE=edge env=is-msie </IfModule> Serve WebP Images If WebP images are supported and an image with a .webp extension and the same name is found at the same place as the jpg/png image that is going to be served, then the WebP image is served instead. apacheconf RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.webp -f RewriteRule (.+)\.(jpe?g|png)$ $1.webp [T=image/webp,E=accept:1] Source
