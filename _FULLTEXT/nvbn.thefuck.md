The Fuck The Fuck is a magnificent app, inspired by a @liamosaur tweet, that corrects errors in previous console commands. Is The Fuck too slow? Try the experimental instant mode! More examples: ```bash ➜ apt-get install vim E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root? ➜ fuck sudo apt-get install vim [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c] [sudo] password for nvbn: Reading package lists... Done ... ``` ```bash ➜ git push fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin master ➜ fuck git push --set-upstream origin master [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c] Counting objects: 9, done. ... ``` ```bash ➜ puthon No command puthon found, did you mean: Command python from package python-minimal (main) Command python from package python3 (main) zsh: command not found: puthon ➜ fuck python [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c] Python 3.4.2 (default, Oct 8 2014, 13:08:17) ... ``` ```bash ➜ git brnch git: brnch is not a git command.

Done ... ``` Requirements python (3.4+) pip python-dev Installation On OS X, you can install The Fuck via Homebrew: bash brew install thefuck On Ubuntu, install The Fuck with the following commands: bash sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip sudo pip3 install thefuck On FreeBSD, install The Fuck with the following commands: bash sudo portsnap fetch update cd /usr/ports/misc/thefuck && sudo make install clean On ChromeOS, install The Fuck using chromebrew with the following command: bash crew install thefuck On other systems, install The Fuck by using pip: bash pip install thefuck Alternatively, you may use an OS package manager (OS X, Ubuntu, Arch). # It is recommended that you place this command in your .bash_profile, .bashrc, .zshrc or other startup script: ```bash eval $(thefuck --alias) You can use whatever you want as an alias, like for Mondays: eval $(thefuck --alias FUCK) ``` Or in your shell config (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Powershell, tcsh). Changes are only available in a new shell session. To make changes immediately available, run source ~/.bashrc (or your shell config file like .zshrc). To run fixed commands without confirmation, use the --yeah option (or just -y for short): bash fuck --yeah To fix commands recursively until succeeding, use the -r option: bash fuck -r Updating bash pip3 install thefuck --upgrade Note: Alias functionality was changed in v1.34 of *The Fuck* How it works The Fuck attempts to match the previous command with a rule.

Creating your own rules To add your own rule, create a file named your-rule-name.py in ~/.config/thefuck/rules. The rule file must contain two functions: python match(command: Command) -> bool get_new_command(command: Command) -> str | list[str] Additionally, rules can contain optional functions: python side_effect(old_command: Command, fixed_command: str) -> None Rules can also contain the optional variables enabled_by_default, requires_output and priority. Command has three attributes: script, output and script_parts. Your rule should not change Command. Rules api changed in 3.0: To access a rules settings, import it with from thefuck.conf import settings settings is a special object assembled from ~/.config/thefuck/settings.py, and values from env (see more below). A simple example rule for running a script with sudo: ```python def match(command): return (permission denied in command.output.lower() or EACCES in command.output) def get_new_command(command): return sudo {}.format(command.script) Optional: enabled_by_default = True def side_effect(command, fixed_command): subprocess.call(chmod 777 ., shell=True) priority = 1000 # Lower first, default is 1000 requires_output = True ``` More examples of rules, utility functions for rules, app/os-specific helpers. Settings Several The Fuck parameters can be changed in the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/thefuck/settings.py ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config): rules – list of enabled rules, by default thefuck.conf.DEFAULT_RULES; exclude_rules – list of disabled rules, by default []; require_confirmation – requires confirmation before running new command, by default True; wait_command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output; no_colors – disable colored output; priority – dict with rules priorities, rule with lower priority will be matched first; debug – enables debug output, by default False; history_limit – numeric value of how many history commands will be scanned, like 2000; alter_history – push fixed command to history, by default True; wait_slow_command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in slow_commands list; slow_commands – list of slow commands. An example of settings.py: python rules = [sudo, no_command] exclude_rules = [git_push] require_confirmation = True wait_command = 10 no_colors = False priority = {sudo: 100, no_command: 9999} debug = False history_limit = 9999 wait_slow_command = 20 slow_commands = [react-native, gradle] Or via environment variables: THEFUCK_RULES – list of enabled rules, like DEFAULT_RULES:rm_root or sudo:no_command; THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES – list of disabled rules, like git_pull:git_push; THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION – require confirmation before running new command, true/false; THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output; THEFUCK_NO_COLORS – disable colored output, true/false; THEFUCK_PRIORITY – priority of the rules, like no_command=9999:apt_get=100, rule with lower priority will be matched first; THEFUCK_DEBUG – enables debug output, true/false; THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT – how many history commands will be scanned, like 2000; THEFUCK_ALTER_HISTORY – push fixed command to history true/false; THEFUCK_WAIT_SLOW_COMMAND – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in slow_commands list; THEFUCK_SLOW_COMMANDS – list of slow commands, like lein:gradle. For example: bash export THEFUCK_RULES=sudo:no_command export THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES=git_pull:git_push export THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true export THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND=10 export THEFUCK_NO_COLORS=false export THEFUCK_PRIORITY=no_command=9999:apt_get=100 export THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT=2000 Third-party packages with rules If youd like to make a specific set of non-public rules, but would still like to share them with others, create a package named thefuck_contrib_* with the following structure: thefuck_contrib_foo thefuck_contrib_foo rules __init__.py *third-party rules* __init__.py *third-party-utils* setup.py The Fuck will find rules located in the rules module. Experimental instant mode The default behavior of The Fuck requires time to re-run previous commands. When in instant mode, The Fuck saves time by logging output with script, then reading the log. Currently, instant mode only supports Python 3 with bash or zsh. zshs autocorrect function also needs to be disabled in order for thefuck to work properly. To enable instant mode, add --enable-experimental-instant-mode to the alias initialization in .bashrc, .bash_profile or .zshrc. For example: bash eval $(thefuck --alias --enable-experimental-instant-mode) Developing See CONTRIBUTING.md License MIT Project License can be found here.
