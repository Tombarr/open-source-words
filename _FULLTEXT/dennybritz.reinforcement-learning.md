Overview This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition) David Silvers Reinforcement Learning Course Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, and links to the relevant readings. All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from OpenAI Gym. Advanced techniques use Tensorflow for neural network implementations.
