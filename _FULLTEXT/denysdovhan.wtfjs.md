What the f*ck JavaScript? A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community. At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud. The original idea for WTFJS belongs to Brian Leroux. This list is highly inspired by his talk “WTFJS” at dotJS 2012: Node Packaged Manuscript You can install this handbook using npm. Just run: $ npm install -g wtfjs You should be able to run wtfjs at the command line now. This will open the manual in your selected $PAGER. Otherwise, you may continue reading on here.

Just because its fun to learn something that we didnt know before. If you are a beginner, you can use these notes to get a deeper dive into JavaScript. I hope these notes will motivate you to spend more time reading the specification. If you are a professional developer, you can consider these examples as a great reference for all of the quirks and unexpected edges of our beloved JavaScript. In any case, just read this. Youre probably going to find something new. ✍🏻 Notation // -> is used to show the result of an expression. For example: js 1 + 1 // -> 2 // > means the result of console.log or another output. For example: js console.log(hello, world!) // > hello, world! // is just a comment used for explanations. Example: js // Assigning a function to foo constant const foo = function () {} 👀 Examples [] is equal ![] Array is equal not array: js [] == ![] // -> true 💡 Explanation: The abstract equality operator converts both sides to numbers to compare them, and both sides become the number 0 for different reasons. Arrays are truthy, so on the right, the opposite of a truthy value is false, which is then coerced to 0. On the left, however, an empty array is coerced to a number without becoming a boolean first, and empty arrays are coerced to 0, despite being truthy. Here is how this expression simplifies: js +[] == +![] 0 == +false 0 == 0 true See also [] is truthy, but not true. 12.5.9 Logical NOT Operator (!) 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison true is false js !!false == !!true // -> true !!false === !!true // -> true 💡 Explanation: Consider this step-by-step: ```js // true is truthy and represented by value 1 (number), true in string form is NaN. true == true // -> false false == false // -> false // false is not the empty string, so its a truthy value !!false // -> true !!true // -> true ``` 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison baNaNa js b + a + + a + a This is an old-school joke in JavaScript, but remastered. Heres the original one: js foo + + bar // -> fooNaN 💡 Explanation: The expression is evaluated as foo + (+bar), which converts bar to not a number. 12.8.3 The Addition Operator (+) 12.5.6 Unary + Operator NaN is not a NaN js NaN === NaN // -> false 💡 Explanation: The specification strictly defines the logic behind this behavior: If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false. If Type(x) is Number, then If x is NaN, return false. If y is NaN, return false. … … … — 7.2.14 Strict Equality Comparison Following the definition of NaN from the IEEE: Four mutually exclusive relations are possible: less than, equal, greater than, and unordered. The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN. Every NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself. — “What is the rationale for all comparisons returning false for IEEE754 NaN values?” at StackOverflow Its a fail You would not believe, but … js (![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]] // -> fail 💡 Explanation: By breaking that mass of symbols into pieces, we notice that the following pattern occurs often: js (![]+[]) // -> false ![] // -> false So we try adding [] to false. But due to a number of internal function calls (binary + Operator -> ToPrimitive -> [[DefaultValue]]) we end up converting the right operand to a string: js (![]+[].toString()) // false Thinking of a string as an array we can access its first character via [0]: js false[0] // -> f The rest is obvious, but the i is tricky. The i in fail is grabbed by generating the string falseundefined and grabbing the element on index [10] [] is truthy, but not true An array is a truthy value, however, its not equal to true. js !![] // -> true [] == true // -> false 💡 Explanation: Here are links to the corresponding sections in the ECMA-262 specification: 12.5.9 Logical NOT Operator (!) 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison null is falsy, but not false Despite the fact that null is a falsy value, its not equal to false. js !!null // -> false null == false // -> false At the same time, other falsy values, like 0 or ` are equal tofalse`. js 0 == false // -> true == false // -> true 💡 Explanation: The explanation is the same as for previous example. Heres the corresponding link: 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison document.all is an object, but it is undefined ⚠️ This is part of the Browser API and wont work in a Node.js environment ⚠️ Despite the fact that document.all is an array-like object and it gives access to the DOM nodes in the page, it responds to the typeof function as undefined. js document.all instanceof Object // -> true typeof document.all // -> undefined At the same time, document.all is not equal to undefined. js document.all === undefined // -> false document.all === null // -> false But at the same time: js document.all == null // -> true 💡 Explanation: document.all used to be a way to access DOM elements, in particular with old versions of IE. While it has never been a standard it was broadly used in the old age JS code. When the standard progressed with new APIs (such as document.getElementById) this API call became obsolete and the standard commitee had to decide what to do with it. Because of its broad use they decided to keep the API but introduce a willful violation of the JavaScript specification. The reason why it responds to false when using the Strict Equality Comparison with undefined while true when using the Abstract Equality Comparison is due to the willful violation of the specification that explicitly allows that. — “Obsolete features - document.all” at WhatWG - HTML spec — “Chapter 4 - ToBoolean - Falsy values” at YDKJS - Types & Grammar Minimal value is greater than zero Number.MIN_VALUE is the smallest number, which is greater than zero: js Number.MIN_VALUE > 0 // -> true 💡 Explanation: Number.MIN_VALUE is 5e-324, i.e. the smallest positive number that can be represented within float precision, i.e. thats as close as you can get to zero. It defines the best resolution that floats can give you. Now the overall smallest value is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY although its not really numeric in a strict sense. — “Why is 0 less than Number.MIN_VALUE in JavaScript?” at StackOverflow 20.1.2.9 Number.MIN_VALUE function is not a function ⚠️ A bug present in V8 v5.5 or lower (Node.js <=7) ⚠️ All of you know about the annoying undefined is not a function, but what about this? ```js // Declare a class which extends null class Foo extends null {} // -> [Function: Foo] new Foo instanceof null // > TypeError: function is not a function // > at … … … ``` 💡 Explanation: This is not a part of the specification. Its just a bug that has now been fixed, so there shouldnt be a problem with it in the future. Adding arrays What if you try to add two arrays? js [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] // -> 1,2,34,5,6 💡 Explanation: The concatenation happens. Step-by-step, it looks like this: js [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] // call toString() [1, 2, 3].toString() + [4, 5, 6].toString() // concatenation 1,2,3 + 4,5,6 // -> 1,2,34,5,6 Trailing commas in array Youve created an array with 4 empty elements. Despite all, youll get an array with three elements, because of trailing commas: js let a = [,,,] a.length // -> 3 a.toString() // -> ,, 💡 Explanation: Trailing commas (sometimes called "final commas") can be useful when adding new elements, parameters, or properties to JavaScript code. If you want to add a new property, you can simply add a new line without modifying the previously last line if that line already uses a trailing comma. This makes version-control diffs cleaner and editing code might be less troublesome. — Trailing commas at MDN Array equality is a monster Array equality is a monster in JS, as you can see below: ```js [] == // -> true [] == 0 // -> true [] == // -> true [0] == 0 // -> true [0] == // -> false [] == 0 // -> true [null] == // true [null] == 0 // true [undefined] == // true [undefined] == 0 // true [[]] == 0 // true [[]] == // true [[[[[[]]]]]] == // true [[[[[[]]]]]] == 0 // true [[[[[[ null ]]]]]] == 0 // true [[[[[[ null ]]]]]] == // true [[[[[[ undefined ]]]]]] == 0 // true [[[[[[ undefined ]]]]]] == // true ``` 💡 Explanation: You should watch very carefully for the above examples! The behaviour is described in section 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison of the specification. undefined and Number If we dont pass any arguments into the Number constructor, well get 0. The value undefined is assigned to formal arguments when there are no actual arguments, so you might expect that Number without arguments takes undefined as a value of its parameter. However, when we pass undefined, we will get NaN. js Number() // -> 0 Number(undefined) // -> NaN 💡 Explanation: According to the specification: If no arguments were passed to this functions invocation, let n be +0. Else, let n be ? ToNumber(value). In case of undefined, ToNumber(undefined) should return NaN. Heres the corresponding section: 20.1.1 The Number Constructor 7.1.3 ToNumber(argument) parseInt is a bad guy parseInt is famous by its quirks: js parseInt(f*ck); // -> NaN parseInt(f*ck, 16); // -> 15 💡 Explanation: This happens because parseInt will continue parsing character-by-character until it hits a character it doesnt know. The f in f*ck is the hexadecimal digit 15. Parsing Infinity to integer is something… js // parseInt(Infinity, 10) // -> NaN // ... parseInt(Infinity, 18) // -> NaN... parseInt(Infinity, 19) // -> 18 // ... parseInt(Infinity, 23) // -> 18... parseInt(Infinity, 24) // -> 151176378 // ... parseInt(Infinity, 29) // -> 385849803 parseInt(Infinity, 30) // -> 13693557269 // ... parseInt(Infinity, 34) // -> 28872273981 parseInt(Infinity, 35) // -> 1201203301724 parseInt(Infinity, 36) // -> 1461559270678... parseInt(Infinity, 37) // -> NaN Be careful with parsing null too: js parseInt(null, 24) // -> 23 💡 Explanation: Its converting null to the string "null" and trying to convert it. For radixes 0 through 23, there are no numerals it can convert, so it returns NaN. At 24, "n", the 14th letter, is added to the numeral system. At 31, "u", the 21st letter, is added and the entire string can be decoded. At 37 on there is no longer any valid numeral set that can be generated and NaN is returned. — “parseInt(null, 24) === 23… wait, what?” at StackOverflow Dont forget about octals: js parseInt(06); // 6 parseInt(08); // 8 if support ECMAScript 5 parseInt(08); // 0 if not support ECMAScript 5 💡 Explanation: If the input string begins with "0", radix is eight (octal) or 10 (decimal). Exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent. ECMAScript 5 specifies that 10 (decimal) is used, but not all browsers support this yet. For this reason always specify a radix when using parseInt. parseInt always convert input to string: js parseInt({ toString: () => 2, valueOf: () => 1 }) // -> 2 Number({ toString: () => 2, valueOf: () => 1 }) // -> 1 Be careful while parsing floating point values js parseInt(0.000001) // -> 0 parseInt(0.0000001) // -> 1 parseInt(1/1999999) // -> 5 💡 Explanation: ParseInt takes a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix. ParseInt also strips anything after and including the first non-digit in the string parameter. 0.000001 is converted to a string "0.000001" and the parseInt returns 0. When 0.0000001 is converted to a string it is treated as "1e-7" and hence parseInt returns 1. 1/1999999 is interpreted as 5.00000250000125e-7 and parseInt returns 5. Math with true and false Lets do some math: js true + true // -> 2 (true + true) * (true + true) - true // -> 3 Hmmm… 🤔 💡 Explanation: We can coerce values to numbers with the Number constructor. Its quite obvious that true will be coerced to 1: js Number(true) // -> 1 The unary plus operator attempts to convert its value into a number. It can convert string representations of integers and floats, as well as the non-string values true, false, and null. If it cannot parse a particular value, it will evaluate to NaN. That means we can coerce true to 1 easier: js +true // -> 1 When youre performing addition or multiplication, the ToNumber method is invoked. According to the specification, this method returns: If argument is true, return 1. If argument is false, return +0. Thats why we can add boolean values as regular numbers and get correct results. Corresponding sections: 12.5.6 Unary + Operator 12.8.3 The Addition Operator (+) 7.1.3 ToNumber(argument) HTML comments are valid in JavaScript You will be impressed, but <!-- (which is known as HTML comment) is a valid comment in JavaScript. js // valid comment <!-- valid comment too 💡 Explanation: Impressed? HTML-like comments were intended to allow browsers that didnt understand the <script> tag to degrade gracefully. These browsers, e.g. Netscape 1.x are no longer popular. So there is really no point in putting HTML comments in your script tags anymore. Since Node.js is based on the V8 engine, HTML-like comments are supported by the Node.js runtime too. Moreover, theyre a part of the specification: B.1.3 HTML-like Comments NaN is ~~not~~ a number Type of NaN is a number: js typeof NaN // -> number 💡 Explanation: Explanations of how typeof and instanceof operators work: 12.5.5 The typeof Operator 12.10.4 Runtime Semantics: InstanceofOperator(O,C) [] and null are objects ```js typeof [] // -> object typeof null // -> object // however null instanceof Object // false ``` 💡 Explanation: The behavior of typeof operator is defined in this section of the specification: 12.5.5 The typeof Operator According to the specification, the typeof operator returns a string according to Table 35: typeof Operator Results. For null, ordinary, standard exotic and non-standard exotic objects, which do not implement [[Call]], it returns the string "object". However, you can check the type of an object by using the toString method. ```js Object.prototype.toString.call([]) // -> [object Array] Object.prototype.toString.call(new Date) // -> [object Date] Object.prototype.toString.call(null) // -> [object Null] ``` Magically increasing numbers ```js 999999999999999 // -> 999999999999999 9999999999999999 // -> 10000000000000000 10000000000000000 // -> 10000000000000000 10000000000000000 + 1 // -> 10000000000000000 10000000000000000 + 1.1 // -> 10000000000000002 ``` 💡 Explanation: This is caused by IEEE 754-2008 standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. At this scale, it rounds to the nearest even number. Read more: 6.1.6 The Number Type IEEE 754 on Wikipedia Precision of 0.1 + 0.2 A well-known joke. An addition of 0.1 and 0.2 is deadly precise: js 0.1 + 0.2 // -> 0.30000000000000004 (0.1 + 0.2) === 0.3 // -> false 💡 Explanation: The answer for the ”Is floating point math broken?” question on StackOverflow: The constants 0.2 and 0.3 in your program will also be approximations to their true values. It happens that the closest double to 0.2 is larger than the rational number 0.2 but that the closest double to 0.3 is smaller than the rational number 0.3. The sum of 0.1 and 0.2 winds up being larger than the rational number 0.3 and hence disagreeing with the constant in your code. This problem is so known that there is even a website called 0.30000000000000004.com. It occurs in every language that uses floating-point math, not just JavaScript. Patching numbers You can add your own methods to wrapper objects like Number or String. ```js Number.prototype.isOne = function () { return Number(this) === 1 } 1.0.isOne() // -> true 1..isOne() // -> true 2.0.isOne() // -> false (7).isOne() // -> false ``` 💡 Explanation: Obviously, you can extend the Number object like any other object in JavaScript. However, its not recommended if the behavior of the defined method is not a part of the specification. Here is the list of Numbers properties: 20.1 Number Objects Comparison of three numbers js 1 < 2 < 3 // -> true 3 > 2 > 1 // -> false 💡 Explanation: Why does this work that way? Well, the problem is in the first part of an expression. Heres how it works: ```js 1 < 2 < 3 // 1 < 2 -> true true < 3 // true -> 1 1 < 3 // -> true 3 > 2 > 1 // 3 > 2 -> true true > 1 // true -> 1 1 > 1 // -> false ``` We can fix this with Greater than or equal operator (>=): js 3 > 2 >= 1 // true Read more about Relational operators in the specification: 12.10 Relational Operators Funny math Often the results of arithmetic operations in JavaScript might be quite unexpected. Consider these examples: ```js 3 - 1 // -> 2 3 + 1 // -> 4 3 - 1 // -> 2 3 + 1 // -> 31 // -> [] + [] // -> {} + [] // -> 0 [] + {} // -> [object Object] {} + {} // -> [object Object][object Object] 222 - -111 // -> 333 [4] * [4] // -> 16 [] * [] // -> 0 [4, 4] * [4, 4] // NaN ``` 💡 Explanation: Whats happening in the first four examples? Heres a small table to understand addition in JavaScript: Number + Number -> addition Boolean + Number -> addition Boolean + Boolean -> addition Number + String -> concatenation String + Boolean -> concatenation String + String -> concatenation What about other examples? A ToPrimitive and ToString methods are being implicitly called for [] and {} before addition. Read more about evaluation process in the specification: 12.8.3 The Addition Operator (+) 7.1.1 ToPrimitive(input [,PreferredType]) 7.1.12 ToString(argument) Addition of RegExps Did you know you can add numbers like this? ```js // Patch a toString method RegExp.prototype.toString = function() { return this.source } /7/ - /5/ // -> 2 ``` 💡 Explanation: 21.2.5.10 get RegExp.prototype.source Strings arent instances of String js str // -> str typeof str // -> string str instanceof String // -> false 💡 Explanation: The String constructor returns a string: js typeof String(str) // -> string String(str) // -> str String(str) == str // -> true Lets try with a new: js new String(str) == str // -> true typeof new String(str) // -> object Object? Whats that? js new String(str) // -> [String: str] More information about the String constructor in the specification: 21.1.1 The String Constructor Calling functions with backticks Lets declare a function which logs all params into the console: js function f(...args) { return args } No doubt, you know you can call this function like this: js f(1, 2, 3) // -> [ 1, 2, 3 ] But did you know you can call any function with backticks? js f`true is ${true}, false is ${false}, array is ${[1,2,3]}` // -> [ [ true is , , false is , , array is , ], // -> true, // -> false, // -> [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] 💡 Explanation: Well, this is not magic at all if youre familiar with Tagged template literals. In the example above, f function is a tag for template literal. Tags before template literal allow you to parse template literals with a function. The first argument of a tag function contains an array of string values. The remaining arguments are related to the expressions. Example: js function template(strings, ...keys) { // do something with strings and keys… } This is the magic behind famous library called 💅 styled-components, which is popular in the React community. Link to the specification: 12.3.7 Tagged Templates Call call call Found by @cramforce js console.log.call.call.call.call.call.apply(a => a, [1, 2]) 💡 Explanation: Attention, it could break your mind! Try to reproduce this code in your head: were applying the call method using the apply method. Read more: 19.2.3.3 Function.prototype.call(thisArg, ...args) 19.2.3.1 Function.prototype.apply(thisArg, argArray) A constructor property js const c = constructor c[c][c](console.log("WTF?"))() // > WTF? 💡 Explanation: Lets consider this example step-by-step: ```js // Declare a new constant which is a string constructor const c = constructor // c is a string c // -> constructor // Getting a constructor of string c[c] // -> [Function: String] // Getting a constructor of constructor c[c][c] // -> [Function: Function] // Call the Function constructor and pass // the body of new function as an argument c[c]c // -> [Function: anonymous] // And then call this anonymous function // The result is console-logging a string WTF? c[c]c() // > WTF? ``` An Object.prototype.constructor returns a reference to the Object constructor function that created the instance object. In case with strings it is String, in case with numbers it is Number and so on. Object.prototype.constructor at MDN 19.1.3.1 Object.prototype.constructor Object as a key of objects property js { [{}]: {} } // -> { [object Object]: {} } 💡 Explanation: Why does this work so? Here were using a Computed property name. When you pass an object between those brackets, it coerces object to a string, so we get the property key [object Object] and the value {}. We can make "brackets hell" like this: ```js ({[{}]:{[{}]:{}}})[{}][{}] // -> {} // structure: // { // [object Object]: { // [object Object]: {} // } // } ``` Read more about object literals here: Object initializer at MDN 12.2.6 Object Initializer Accessing prototypes with __proto__ As we know, primitives dont have prototypes. However, if we try to get a value of __proto__ for primitives, we would get this: js (1).__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ // -> null 💡 Explanation: This happens because when something doesnt have a prototype, it will be wrapped into a wrapper object using the ToObject method. So, step-by-step: js (1).__proto__ // -> [Number: 0] (1).__proto__.__proto__ // -> {} (1).__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ // -> null Here is more information about __proto__: B.2.2.1 Object.prototype.proto 7.1.13 ToObject(argument) `${{Object}}` What is the result of the expression below? js `${{Object}}` The answer is: js // -> [object Object] 💡 Explanation: We defined an object with a property Object using Shorthand property notation: js { Object: Object } Then weve passed this object to the template literal, so the toString method calls for that object. Thats why we get the string [object Object]. 12.2.9 Template Literals Object initializer at MDN Destructuring with default values Consider this example: js let x, { x: y = 1 } = { x }; y; The example above is a great task for an interview. What the value of y? The answer is: js // -> 1 💡 Explanation: js let x, { x: y = 1 } = { x }; y; // ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ // 1 3 2 4 With the example above: We declare x with no value, so its undefined. Then we pack the value of x into the object property x. Then we extract the value of x using destructuring and want to assign it to y. If the value is not defined, then were going to use 1 as the default value. Return the value of y. Object initializer at MDN Dots and spreading Interesting examples could be composed with spreading of arrays. Consider this: js [...[......]].length // -> 3 💡 Explanation: Why 3? When we use the spread operator, the @@iterator method is called, and the returned iterator is used to obtain the values to be iterated. The default iterator for string spreads a string into characters. After spreading, we pack these characters into an array. Then we spread this array again and pack it back to an array. A ... string consists with three . characters, so the length of resulting array is 3. Now, step-by-step: js [......] // -> [ ., ., . ] [...[......]] // -> [ ., ., . ] [...[......]].length // -> 3 Obviously, we can spread and wrap the elements of an array as many times as we want: js [......] // -> [ ., ., . ] [...[......]] // -> [ ., ., . ] [...[...[......]]] // -> [ ., ., . ] [...[...[...[......]]]] // -> [ ., ., . ] // and so on … Labels Not many programmers know about labels in JavaScript. They are kind of interesting: ```js foo: { console.log(first); break foo; console.log(second); } // > first // -> undefined ``` 💡 Explanation: The labeled statement is used with break or continue statements. You can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution. In the example above, we identify a label foo. After that console.log(first); executes and then we interrupt the execution. Read more about labels in JavaScript: 13.13 Labelled Statements Labeled statements at MDN Nested labels js a: b: c: d: e: f: g: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; // -> 5 💡 Explanation: Similar to previous examples, follow these links: 12.16 Comma Operator (,) 13.13 Labelled Statements Labeled statements at MDN Insidious try..catch What will this expression return? 2 or 3? js (() => { try { return 2; } finally { return 3; } })() The answer is 3. Surprised? 💡 Explanation: 13.15 The try Statement Is this multiple inheritance? Take a look at the example below: js new (class F extends (String, Array) { }) // -> F [] Is this a multiple inheritance? Nope. 💡 Explanation: The interesting part is the value of the extends clause ((String, Array)). The grouping operator always returns its last argument, so (String, Array) is actually just Array. That means weve just created a class which extends Array. 14.5 Class Definitions 12.16 Comma Operator (,) A generator which yields itself Consider this example of a generator which yields itself: js (function* f() { yield f })().next() // -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false } As you can see, the returned value is an object with its value equal to f. In that case, we can do something like this: ```js (function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next() // -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false } // and again (function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next().value().next() // -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false } // and again (function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next().value().next().value().next() // -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false } // and so on // … ``` 💡 Explanation: To understand why this works that way, read these sections of the specification: 25 Control Abstraction Objects 25.3 Generator Objects A class of class Consider this obfuscated syntax playing: js (typeof (new (class { class () {} }))) // -> object It seems like were declaring a class inside of class. Should be an error, however, we get the string object. 💡 Explanation: Since ECMAScript 5 era, keywords are allowed as property names. So think about it as this simple object example: js const foo = { class: function() {} }; And ES6 standardized shorthand method definitions. Also, classes can be anonymous. So if we drop : function part, were going to get: js class { class() {} } The result of a default class is always a simple object. And its typeof should return object. Read more here: 14.3 Method Definitions 14.5 Class Definitions Non-coercible objects With well-known symbols, theres a way to get rid of type coercion. Take a look: ```js function nonCoercible(val) { if (val == null) { throw TypeError(nonCoercible should not be called with null or undefined) } const res = Object(val) res[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => { throw TypeError(Trying to coerce non-coercible object) } return res } ``` Now we can use this like this: ```js // objects const foo = nonCoercible({foo: foo}) foo * 10 // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object foo + evil // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object // strings const bar = nonCoercible(bar) bar + 1 // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object bar.toString() + 1 // -> bar1 bar === bar // -> false bar.toString() === bar // -> true bar == bar // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object // numbers const baz = nonCoercible(1) baz == 1 // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object baz === 1 // -> false baz.valueOf() === 1 // -> true ``` 💡 Explanation: A gist by Sergey Rubanov 6.1.5.1 Well-Known Symbols Tricky arrow functions Consider the example below: js let f = () => 10 f() // -> 10 Okay, fine, but what about this: js let f = () => {} f() // -> undefined 💡 Explanation: You might expect {} instead of undefined. This is because the curly braces are part of the syntax of the arrow functions, so f will return undefined. It is however possible to return the {} object directly from an arrow function, by enclosing the return value with brackets. js let f = () => ({}) f() // -> {} Arrow functions can not be a constructor Consider the example below: js let f = function () { this.a = 1; } new f(); // -> { a: 1 } Now, try do to the same with an arrow function: js let f = () => { this.a = 1; }; new f(); // -> TypeError: f is not a constructor 💡 Explanation: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error when used with new. Because has a lexical this, and do not have a prototype property, so it would not make much sense. arguments and arrow functions Consider the example below: js let f = function(){ return arguments; } f(a); // -> { 0: a } Now, try do to the same with an arrow function: js let f = () => arguments; f(a); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: arguments is not defined 💡 Explanation: Arrow functions are a lightweight version of regular functions with a focus on being short and lexical this. At the same time arrow functions do not provide a binding for the arguments object. As a valid alternative use the rest parameters to achieve the same result: js let f = (...args) => args; f(a); Arrow functions at MDN. Tricky return return statement is also tricky. Consider this: js (function () { return { b : 10 } })() // -> undefined 💡 Explanation: return and the returned expression must be in the same line: js (function () { return { b : 10 } })() // -> { b: 10 } This is because of a concept called Automatic Semicolon Insertion, which automagically inserts semicolons after most newlines. In the first example, there is a semicolon inserted between the return statement and the object literal, so the function returns undefined and the object literal is never evaluated. 11.9.1 Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion 13.10 The return Statement Accessing object properties with arrays ```js var obj = { property: 1 } var array = [property] obj[array] // -> 1 ``` What about pseudo-multidimensional arrays? ```js var map = {} var x = 1 var y = 2 var z = 3 map[[x, y, z]] = true map[[x + 10, y, z]] = true map["1,2,3"] // -> true map["11,2,3"] // -> true ``` 💡 Explanation: The brackets [] operator converts the passed expression using toString. Converting a one-element array to a string is akin to converting the contained element to the string: js [property].toString() // -> property Null and Relational Operators ```js null > 0; // false null == 0; // false null >= 0; // true ``` 💡 Explanation: Long story short, if null is less than 0 is false, then null >= 0 is true. Read in-depth explanation for this here. Number.toFixed() display different numbers Number.toFixed() can behave a bit strange in different browsers. Check out this example: js 0.7875.toFixed(3) // Firefox: -> 0.787 // Chrome: -> 0.787 // IE11: -> 0.788 0.7876.toFixed(3) // Firefox: -> 0.788 // Chrome: -> 0.788 // IE11: -> 0.788 💡 Explanation: While your first instinct may be that IE11 is correct and Firefox/Chrome are wrong, the reality is that Firefox/Chrome are more directly obeying standards for numbers (IEEE-754 Floating Point), while IE11 is minutely disobeying them in (what is probably) an effort to give clearer results. You can see why this occurs with a few quick tests: js // Confirm the odd result of rounding a 5 down 0.7875.toFixed(3) // -> 0.787 // It looks like its just a 5 when you expand to the // limits of 64-bit (double-precision) float accuracy 0.7875.toFixed(14) // -> 0.78750000000000 // But what if you go beyond the limit? 0.7875.toFixed(20) // -> 0.78749999999999997780 Floating point numbers are not stored as a list of decimal digits internally, but through a more complicated methodology that produces tiny inaccuracies that are usually rounded away by toString and similar calls, but are actually present internally. In this case, that "5" on the end was actually an extremely tiny fraction below a true 5. Rounding it at any reasonable length will render it as a 5... but it is actually not a 5 internally. IE11, however, will report the value input with only zeros appended to the end even in the toFixed(20) case, as it seems to be forcibly rounding the value to reduce the troubles from hardware limits. See for reference NOTE 2 on the ECMA-262 definition for toFixed. 20.1.3.3 Number.prototype.toFixed (fractionDigits) Math.max() less than Math.min() js Math.min(1,4,7,2) // -> 1 Math.max(1,4,7,2) // -> 7 Math.min() // -> Infinity Math.max() // -> -Infinity Math.min() > Math.max() // -> true 💡 Explanation: Why is Math.max() less than Math.min()? by Charlie Harvey Comparing null to 0 The following expressions seem to introduce a contradiction: js null == 0 // -> false null > 0 // -> false null >= 0 // -> true How can null be neither equal to nor greater than 0, if null >= 0 is actually true? (This also works with less than in the same way.) 💡 Explanation: The way these three expressions are evaluated are all different and are responsible for producing this unexpected behavior. First, the abstract equality comparison null == 0. Normally, if this operator cant compare the values on either side properly, it converts both to numbers and compares the numbers. Then, you might expect the following behavior: js // This is not what happens null == 0 +null == +0 0 == 0 true However, according to a close reading of the spec, the number conversion doesnt actually happen on a side that is null or undefined. Therefore, if you have null on one side of the equal sign, the other side must be null or undefined for the expression to return true. Since this is not the case, false is returned. Next, the relational comparison null > 0. The algorithm here, unlike that of the abstract equality operator, will convert null to a number. Therefore, we get this behavior: js null > 0 +null = +0 0 > 0 false Finally, the relational comparison null >= 0. You could argue that this expression should be the result of null > 0 || null == 0; if this were the case, then the above results would mean that this would also be false. However, the >= operator in fact works in a very different way, which is basically to take the opposite of the < operator. Because our example with the greater than operator above also holds for the less than operator, that means this expression is actually evaluated like so: js null >= 0 !(null < 0) !(+null < +0) !(0 < 0) !(false) true 7.2.12 Abstract Relational Comparison 7.2.13 Abstract Equality Comparison Same variable redeclaration JS allows to redeclare variables: js a; a; // This is also valid a, a; Works also in strict mode: js var a, a, a; var a; var a; 💡 Explanation: All defenitions are merged into one definition. 13.3.2 Variable Statement Other resources wtfjs.com — a collection of those very special irregularities, inconsistencies and just plain painfully unintuitive moments for the language of the web.
