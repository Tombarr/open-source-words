Sinatra Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort: ```ruby myapp.rb require sinatra get / do Hello world! end ``` Install the gem: shell gem install sinatra And run with: shell ruby myapp.rb View at: http://localhost:4567 The code you changed will not take effect until you restart the server. Please restart the server every time you change or use sinatra/reloader. It is recommended to also run gem install thin, which Sinatra will pick up if available.

Using Sinatra as Middleware Dynamic Application Creation Scopes and Binding Application/Class Scope Request/Instance Scope Delegation Scope Command Line Multi-threading Requirement The Bleeding Edge With Bundler Versioning Further Reading Routes In Sinatra, a route is an HTTP method paired with a URL-matching pattern. Each route is associated with a block: ```ruby get / do .. show something .. end post / do .. create something .. end put / do .. replace something .. end patch / do .. modify something .. end delete / do .. annihilate something .. end options / do .. appease something .. end link / do .. affiliate something .. end unlink / do .. separate something .. end ``` Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route that matches the request is invoked. Routes with trailing slashes are different from the ones without: ruby get /foo do # Does not match "GET /foo/" end Route patterns may include named parameters, accessible via the params hash: ruby get /hello/:name do # matches "GET /hello/foo" and "GET /hello/bar" # params[name] is foo or bar "Hello #{params[name]}!" end You can also access named parameters via block parameters: ruby get /hello/:name do |n| # matches "GET /hello/foo" and "GET /hello/bar" # params[name] is foo or bar # n stores params[name] "Hello #{n}!" end Route patterns may also include splat (or wildcard) parameters, accessible via the params[splat] array: ```ruby get /say//to/ do # matches /say/hello/to/world params[splat] # => ["hello", "world"] end get /download/. do # matches /download/path/to/file.xml params[splat] # => ["path/to/file", "xml"] end ``` Or with block parameters: ruby get /download/*.* do |path, ext| [path, ext] # => ["path/to/file", "xml"] end Route matching with Regular Expressions: ruby get /\/hello\/([\w]+)/ do "Hello, #{params[captures].first}!" end Or with a block parameter: ruby get %r{/hello/([\w]+)} do |c| # Matches "GET /meta/hello/world", "GET /hello/world/1234" etc. "Hello, #{c}!" end Route patterns may have optional parameters: ruby get /posts/:format? do # matches "GET /posts/" and any extension "GET /posts/json", "GET /posts/xml" etc end Routes may also utilize query parameters: ruby get /posts do # matches "GET /posts?title=foo&author=bar" title = params[title] author = params[author] # uses title and author variables; query is optional to the /posts route end By the way, unless you disable the path traversal attack protection (see below), the request path might be modified before matching against your routes. You may customize the Mustermann options used for a given route by passing in a :mustermann_opts hash: ruby get \A/posts\z, :mustermann_opts => { :type => :regexp, :check_anchors => false } do # matches /posts exactly, with explicit anchoring "If you match an anchored pattern clap your hands!" end It looks like a condition, but it isnt one! These options will be merged into the global :mustermann_opts hash described below. Conditions Routes may include a variety of matching conditions, such as the user agent: ```ruby get /foo, :agent => /Songbird (\d.\d)[\d\/]*?/ do "Youre using Songbird version #{params[agent][0]}" end get /foo do # Matches non-songbird browsers end ``` Other available conditions are host_name and provides: ```ruby get /, :host_name => /^admin./ do "Admin Area, Access denied!" end get /, :provides => html do haml :index end get /, :provides => [rss, atom, xml] do builder :feed end ``provides` searches the requests Accept header. You can easily define your own conditions: ```ruby set(:probability) { |value| condition { rand <= value } } get /win_a_car, :probability => 0.1 do "You won!" end get /win_a_car do "Sorry, you lost." end ``` For a condition that takes multiple values use a splat: ```ruby set(:auth) do |*roles| # <- notice the splat here condition do unless logged_in? && roles.any? {|role| current_user.in_role? role } redirect "/login/", 303 end end end get "/my/account/", :auth => [:user, :admin] do "Your Account Details" end get "/only/admin/", :auth => :admin do "Only admins are allowed here!" end ``` Return Values The return value of a route block determines at least the response body passed on to the HTTP client, or at least the next middleware in the Rack stack. Most commonly, this is a string, as in the above examples. But other values are also accepted. You can return any object that would either be a valid Rack response, Rack body object or HTTP status code: An Array with three elements: [status (Fixnum), headers (Hash), response body (responds to #each)] An Array with two elements: [status (Fixnum), response body (responds to #each)] An object that responds to #each and passes nothing but strings to the given block A Fixnum representing the status code That way we can, for instance, easily implement a streaming example: ```ruby class Stream def each 100.times { |i| yield "#{i}\n" } end end get(/) { Stream.new } ``` You can also use the stream helper method (described below) to reduce boiler plate and embed the streaming logic in the route. Custom Route Matchers As shown above, Sinatra ships with built-in support for using String patterns and regular expressions as route matches. However, it does not stop there. You can easily define your own matchers: ```ruby class AllButPattern Match = Struct.new(:captures) def initialize(except) @except = except @captures = Match.new([]) end def match(str) @captures unless @except === str end end def all_but(pattern) AllButPattern.new(pattern) end get all_but("/index") do # ... end ``` Note that the above example might be over-engineered, as it can also be expressed as: ruby get // do pass if request.path_info == "/index" # ... end Or, using negative look ahead: ruby get %r{(?!/index)} do # ... end Static Files Static files are served from the ./public directory. You can specify a different location by setting the :public_folder option: ruby set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + /static Note that the public directory name is not included in the URL. A file ./public/css/style.css is made available as http://example.com/css/style.css. Use the :static_cache_control setting (see below) to add Cache-Control header info. Views / Templates Each template language is exposed via its own rendering method. These methods simply return a string: ruby get / do erb :index end This renders views/index.erb. Instead of a template name, you can also just pass in the template content directly: ruby get / do code = "<%= Time.now %>" erb code end Templates take a second argument, the options hash: ruby get / do erb :index, :layout => :post end This will render views/index.erb embedded in the views/post.erb (default is views/layout.erb, if it exists). Any options not understood by Sinatra will be passed on to the template engine: ruby get / do haml :index, :format => :html5 end You can also set options per template language in general: ```ruby set :haml, :format => :html5 get / do haml :index end ``` Options passed to the render method override options set via set. Available Options: locals List of locals passed to the document. Handy with partials. Example: erb "<%= foo %>", :locals => {:foo => "bar"} default_encoding String encoding to use if uncertain. Defaults to settings.default_encoding. views Views folder to load templates from. Defaults to settings.views. layout Whether to use a layout (true or false). If its a Symbol, specifies what template to use. Example: erb :index, :layout => !request.xhr? content_type Content-Type the template produces. Default depends on template language. scope Scope to render template under. Defaults to the application instance. If you change this, instance variables and helper methods will not be available. layout_engine Template engine to use for rendering the layout. Useful for languages that do not support layouts otherwise. Defaults to the engine used for the template. Example: set :rdoc, :layout_engine => :erb layout_options Special options only used for rendering the layout. Example: set :rdoc, :layout_options => { :views => views/layouts } Templates are assumed to be located directly under the ./views directory. To use a different views directory: ruby set :views, settings.root + /templates One important thing to remember is that you always have to reference templates with symbols, even if theyre in a subdirectory (in this case, use: :subdir/template or subdir/template.to_sym). You must use a symbol because otherwise rendering methods will render any strings passed to them directly. Literal Templates ruby get / do haml %div.title Hello World end Renders the template string. You can optionally specify :path and :line for a clearer backtrace if there is a filesystem path or line associated with that string: ruby get / do haml %div.title Hello World, :path => examples/file.haml, :line => 3 end Available Template Languages Some languages have multiple implementations. To specify what implementation to use (and to be thread-safe), you should simply require it first: ruby require rdiscount # or require bluecloth get(/) { markdown :index } Haml Templates Dependency haml File Extension .haml Example haml :index, :format => :html5 Erb Templates Dependency erubis or erb (included in Ruby) File Extensions .erb, .rhtml or .erubis (Erubis only) Example erb :index Builder Templates Dependency builder File Extension .builder Example builder { |xml| xml.em "hi" } It also takes a block for inline templates (see example). Nokogiri Templates Dependency nokogiri File Extension .nokogiri Example nokogiri { |xml| xml.em "hi" } It also takes a block for inline templates (see example). Sass Templates Dependency sass File Extension .sass Example sass :stylesheet, :style => :expanded SCSS Templates Dependency sass File Extension .scss Example scss :stylesheet, :style => :expanded Less Templates Dependency less File Extension .less Example less :stylesheet Liquid Templates Dependency liquid File Extension .liquid Example liquid :index, :locals => { :key => value } Since you cannot call Ruby methods (except for yield) from a Liquid template, you almost always want to pass locals to it. Markdown Templates Dependency Anyone of: RDiscount, RedCarpet, BlueCloth, kramdown, maruku File Extensions .markdown, .mkd and .md Example markdown :index, :layout_engine => :erb It is not possible to call methods from Markdown, nor to pass locals to it. You therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine: ruby erb :overview, :locals => { :text => markdown(:introduction) } Note that you may also call the markdown method from within other templates: ruby %h1 Hello From Haml! %p= markdown(:greetings) Since you cannot call Ruby from Markdown, you cannot use layouts written in Markdown. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the template than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option. Textile Templates Dependency RedCloth File Extension .textile Example textile :index, :layout_engine => :erb It is not possible to call methods from Textile, nor to pass locals to it. You therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine: ruby erb :overview, :locals => { :text => textile(:introduction) } Note that you may also call the textile method from within other templates: ruby %h1 Hello From Haml! %p= textile(:greetings) Since you cannot call Ruby from Textile, you cannot use layouts written in Textile. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the template than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option. RDoc Templates Dependency RDoc File Extension .rdoc Example rdoc :README, :layout_engine => :erb It is not possible to call methods from RDoc, nor to pass locals to it. You therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine: ruby erb :overview, :locals => { :text => rdoc(:introduction) } Note that you may also call the rdoc method from within other templates: ruby %h1 Hello From Haml! %p= rdoc(:greetings) Since you cannot call Ruby from RDoc, you cannot use layouts written in RDoc. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the template than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option. AsciiDoc Templates Dependency Asciidoctor File Extension .asciidoc, .adoc and .ad Example asciidoc :README, :layout_engine => :erb Since you cannot call Ruby methods directly from an AsciiDoc template, you almost always want to pass locals to it. Radius Templates Dependency Radius File Extension .radius Example radius :index, :locals => { :key => value } Since you cannot call Ruby methods directly from a Radius template, you almost always want to pass locals to it. Markaby Templates Dependency Markaby File Extension .mab Example markaby { h1 "Welcome!" } It also takes a block for inline templates (see example). RABL Templates Dependency Rabl File Extension .rabl Example rabl :index Slim Templates Dependency Slim Lang File Extension .slim Example slim :index Creole Templates Dependency Creole File Extension .creole Example creole :wiki, :layout_engine => :erb It is not possible to call methods from Creole, nor to pass locals to it. You therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine: ruby erb :overview, :locals => { :text => creole(:introduction) } Note that you may also call the creole method from within other templates: ruby %h1 Hello From Haml! %p= creole(:greetings) Since you cannot call Ruby from Creole, you cannot use layouts written in Creole. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the template than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option. MediaWiki Templates Dependency WikiCloth File Extension .mediawiki and .mw Example mediawiki :wiki, :layout_engine => :erb It is not possible to call methods from MediaWiki markup, nor to pass locals to it. You therefore will usually use it in combination with another rendering engine: ruby erb :overview, :locals => { :text => mediawiki(:introduction) } Note that you may also call the mediawiki method from within other templates: ruby %h1 Hello From Haml! %p= mediawiki(:greetings) Since you cannot call Ruby from MediaWiki, you cannot use layouts written in MediaWiki. However, it is possible to use another rendering engine for the template than for the layout by passing the :layout_engine option. CoffeeScript Templates Dependency CoffeeScript and a way to execute javascript File Extension .coffee Example coffee :index Stylus Templates Dependency Stylus and a way to execute javascript File Extension .styl Example stylus :index Before being able to use Stylus templates, you need to load stylus and stylus/tilt first: ```ruby require sinatra require stylus require stylus/tilt get / do stylus :example end ``` Yajl Templates Dependency yajl-ruby File Extension .yajl Example yajl :index, :locals => { :key => qux }, :callback => present, :variable => resource The template source is evaluated as a Ruby string, and the resulting json variable is converted using #to_json: ruby json = { :foo => bar } json[:baz] = key The :callback and :variable options can be used to decorate the rendered object: javascript var resource = {"foo":"bar","baz":"qux"}; present(resource); WLang Templates Dependency WLang File Extension .wlang Example wlang :index, :locals => { :key => value } Since calling ruby methods is not idiomatic in WLang, you almost always want to pass locals to it. Layouts written in WLang and yield are supported, though. Accessing Variables in Templates Templates are evaluated within the same context as route handlers. Instance variables set in route handlers are directly accessible by templates: ruby get /:id do @foo = Foo.find(params[id]) haml %h1= @foo.name end Or, specify an explicit Hash of local variables: ruby get /:id do foo = Foo.find(params[id]) haml %h1= bar.name, :locals => { :bar => foo } end This is typically used when rendering templates as partials from within other templates. Templates with yield and nested layouts A layout is usually just a template that calls yield. Such a template can be used either through the :template option as described above, or it can be rendered with a block as follows: ruby erb :post, :layout => false do erb :index end This code is mostly equivalent to erb :index, :layout => :post. Passing blocks to rendering methods is most useful for creating nested layouts: ruby erb :main_layout, :layout => false do erb :admin_layout do erb :user end end This can also be done in fewer lines of code with: ruby erb :admin_layout, :layout => :main_layout do erb :user end Currently, the following rendering methods accept a block: erb, haml, liquid, slim, wlang. Also the general render method accepts a block. Inline Templates Templates may be defined at the end of the source file: ```ruby require sinatra get / do haml :index end END @@ layout %html = yield @@ index %div.title Hello world. ``` NOTE: Inline templates defined in the source file that requires sinatra are automatically loaded. Call enable :inline_templates explicitly if you have inline templates in other source files. Named Templates Templates may also be defined using the top-level template method: ```ruby template :layout do "%html\n =yield\n" end template :index do %div.title Hello World! end get / do haml :index end ``` If a template named "layout" exists, it will be used each time a template is rendered. You can individually disable layouts by passing :layout => false or disable them by default via set :haml, :layout => false: ruby get / do haml :index, :layout => !request.xhr? end Associating File Extensions To associate a file extension with a template engine, use Tilt.register. For instance, if you like to use the file extension tt for Textile templates, you can do the following: ruby Tilt.register :tt, Tilt[:textile] Adding Your Own Template Engine First, register your engine with Tilt, then create a rendering method: ```ruby Tilt.register :myat, MyAwesomeTemplateEngine helpers do def myat(args) render(:myat, args) end end get / do myat :index end ``` Renders ./views/index.myat. Learn more about Tilt. Using Custom Logic for Template Lookup To implement your own template lookup mechanism you can write your own #find_template method: ```ruby configure do set :views [ ./views/a, ./views/b ] end def find_template(views, name, engine, &block) Array(views).each do |v| super(v, name, engine, &block) end end ``` Filters Before filters are evaluated before each request within the same context as the routes will be and can modify the request and response. Instance variables set in filters are accessible by routes and templates: ```ruby before do @note = Hi! request.path_info = /foo/bar/baz end get /foo/* do @note #=> Hi! params[splat] #=> bar/baz end ``` After filters are evaluated after each request within the same context as the routes will be and can also modify the request and response. Instance variables set in before filters and routes are accessible by after filters: ruby after do puts response.status end Note: Unless you use the body method rather than just returning a String from the routes, the body will not yet be available in the after filter, since it is generated later on. Filters optionally take a pattern, causing them to be evaluated only if the request path matches that pattern: ```ruby before /protected/* do authenticate! end after /create/:slug do |slug| session[:last_slug] = slug end ``` Like routes, filters also take conditions: ```ruby before :agent => /Songbird/ do # ... end after /blog/*, :host_name => example.com do # ... end ``` Helpers Use the top-level helpers method to define helper methods for use in route handlers and templates: ```ruby helpers do def bar(name) "#{name}bar" end end get /:name do bar(params[name]) end ``` Alternatively, helper methods can be separately defined in a module: ```ruby module FooUtils def foo(name) "#{name}foo" end end module BarUtils def bar(name) "#{name}bar" end end helpers FooUtils, BarUtils ``` The effect is the same as including the modules in the application class. Using Sessions A session is used to keep state during requests. If activated, you have one session hash per user session: ```ruby enable :sessions get / do "value = " << session[:value].inspect end get /:value do session[value] = params[value] end ``` Session Secret Security To improve security, the session data in the cookie is signed with a session secret using HMAC-SHA1. This session secret should optimally be a cryptographically secure random value of an appropriate length which for HMAC-SHA1 is greater than or equal to 64 bytes (512 bits, 128 hex characters). You would be advised not to use a secret that is less than 32 bytes of randomness (256 bits, 64 hex characters). It is therefore very important that you dont just make the secret up, but instead use a secure random number generator to create it. Humans are extremely bad at generating random values. By default, a 32 byte secure random session secret is generated for you by Sinatra, but it will change with every restart of your application. If you have multiple instances of your application, and you let Sinatra generate the key, each instance would then have a different session key which is probably not what you want. For better security and usability its recommended that you generate a secure random secret and store it in an environment variable on each host running your application so that all of your application instances will share the same secret. You should periodically rotate this session secret to a new value. Here are some examples of how you might create a 64 byte secret and set it: Session Secret Generation text $ ruby -e "require securerandom; puts SecureRandom.hex(64)" 99ae8af...snip...ec0f262ac Session Secret Generation (Bonus Points) Use the sysrandom gem to prefer use of system RNG facilities to generate random values instead of userspace OpenSSL which MRI Ruby currently defaults to: ```text $ gem install sysrandom Building native extensions. This could take a while... Successfully installed sysrandom-1.x 1 gem installed $ ruby -e "require sysrandom/securerandom; puts SecureRandom.hex(64)" 99ae8af...snip...ec0f262ac ``` Session Secret Environment Variable Set a SESSION_SECRET environment variable for Sinatra to the value you generated. Make this value persistent across reboots of your host. Since the method for doing this will vary across systems this is for illustrative purposes only: ```bash echo "export SESSION_SECRET=99ae8af...snip...ec0f262ac" >> ~/.bashrc ``` Session Secret App Config Setup your app config to fail-safe to a secure random secret if the SESSION_SECRET environment variable is not available. For bonus points use the sysrandom gem here as well: ```ruby require securerandom -or- require sysrandom/securerandom set :session_secret, ENV.fetch(SESSION_SECRET) { SecureRandom.hex(64) } ``` Session Config If you want to configure it further, you may also store a hash with options in the sessions setting: ruby set :sessions, :domain => foo.com To share your session across other apps on subdomains of foo.com, prefix the domain with a . like this instead: ruby set :sessions, :domain => .foo.com Choosing Your Own Session Middleware Note that enable :sessions actually stores all data in a cookie. This might not always be what you want (storing lots of data will increase your traffic, for instance). You can use any Rack session middleware in order to do so, one of the following methods can be used: ruby enable :sessions set :session_store, Rack::Session::Pool Or to set up sessions with a hash of options: ruby set :sessions, :expire_after => 2592000 set :session_store, Rack::Session::Pool Another option is to not call enable :sessions, but instead pull in your middleware of choice as you would any other middleware. It is important to note that when using this method, session based protection will not be enabled by default. The Rack middleware to do that will also need to be added: ruby use Rack::Session::Pool, :expire_after => 2592000 use Rack::Protection::RemoteToken use Rack::Protection::SessionHijacking See Configuring attack protection for more information. Halting To immediately stop a request within a filter or route use: ruby halt You can also specify the status when halting: ruby halt 410 Or the body: ruby halt this will be the body Or both: ruby halt 401, go away! With headers: ruby halt 402, {Content-Type => text/plain}, revenge It is of course possible to combine a template with halt: ruby halt erb(:error) Passing A route can punt processing to the next matching route using pass: ```ruby get /guess/:who do pass unless params[who] == Frank You got me! end get /guess/* do You missed! end ``` The route block is immediately exited and control continues with the next matching route. If no matching route is found, a 404 is returned. Triggering Another Route Sometimes pass is not what you want, instead you would like to get the result of calling another route. Simply use call to achieve this: ```ruby get /foo do status, headers, body = call env.merge("PATH_INFO" => /bar) [status, headers, body.map(&:upcase)] end get /bar do "bar" end ``` Note that in the example above, you would ease testing and increase performance by simply moving "bar" into a helper used by both /foo and /bar. If you want the request to be sent to the same application instance rather than a duplicate, use call! instead of call. Check out the Rack specification if you want to learn more about call. Setting Body, Status Code and Headers It is possible and recommended to set the status code and response body with the return value of the route block. However, in some scenarios you might want to set the body at an arbitrary point in the execution flow. You can do so with the body helper method. If you do so, you can use that method from there on to access the body: ```ruby get /foo do body "bar" end after do puts body end ``` It is also possible to pass a block to body, which will be executed by the Rack handler (this can be used to implement streaming, see "Return Values"). Similar to the body, you can also set the status code and headers: ruby get /foo do status 418 headers \ "Allow" => "BREW, POST, GET, PROPFIND, WHEN", "Refresh" => "Refresh: 20; https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt" body "Im a tea pot!" end Like body, headers and status with no arguments can be used to access their current values. Streaming Responses Sometimes you want to start sending out data while still generating parts of the response body. In extreme examples, you want to keep sending data until the client closes the connection. You can use the stream helper to avoid creating your own wrapper: ruby get / do stream do |out| out << "Its gonna be legen -\n" sleep 0.5 out << " (wait for it) \n" sleep 1 out << "- dary!\n" end end This allows you to implement streaming APIs, Server Sent Events, and can be used as the basis for WebSockets. It can also be used to increase throughput if some but not all content depends on a slow resource. Note that the streaming behavior, especially the number of concurrent requests, highly depends on the web server used to serve the application. Some servers might not even support streaming at all. If the server does not support streaming, the body will be sent all at once after the block passed to stream finishes executing. Streaming does not work at all with Shotgun. If the optional parameter is set to keep_open, it will not call close on the stream object, allowing you to close it at any later point in the execution flow. This only works on evented servers, like Thin and Rainbows. Other servers will still close the stream: ```ruby long polling set :server, :thin connections = [] get /subscribe do # register a clients interest in server events stream(:keep_open) do |out| connections << out # purge dead connections connections.reject!(&:closed?) end end post /:message do connections.each do |out| # notify client that a new message has arrived out << params[message] << "\n" # indicate client to connect again out.close end # acknowledge "message received" end ``` Its also possible for the client to close the connection when trying to write to the socket. Because of this, its recommended to check out.closed? before trying to write. Logging In the request scope, the logger helper exposes a Logger instance: ruby get / do logger.info "loading data" # ... end This logger will automatically take your Rack handlers logging settings into account. If logging is disabled, this method will return a dummy object, so you do not have to worry about it in your routes and filters. Note that logging is only enabled for Sinatra::Application by default, so if you inherit from Sinatra::Base, you probably want to enable it yourself: ruby class MyApp < Sinatra::Base configure :production, :development do enable :logging end end To avoid any logging middleware to be set up, set the logging setting to nil. However, keep in mind that logger will in that case return nil. A common use case is when you want to set your own logger. Sinatra will use whatever it will find in env[rack.logger]. Mime Types When using send_file or static files you may have mime types Sinatra doesnt understand. Use mime_type to register them by file extension: ruby configure do mime_type :foo, text/foo end You can also use it with the content_type helper: ruby get / do content_type :foo "foo foo foo" end Generating URLs For generating URLs you should use the url helper method, for instance, in Haml: ruby %a{:href => url(/foo)} foo It takes reverse proxies and Rack routers into account, if present. This method is also aliased to to (see below for an example). Browser Redirect You can trigger a browser redirect with the redirect helper method: ruby get /foo do redirect to(/bar) end Any additional parameters are handled like arguments passed to halt: ruby redirect to(/bar), 303 redirect http://www.google.com/, wrong place, buddy You can also easily redirect back to the page the user came from with redirect back: ```ruby get /foo do "do something" end get /bar do do_something redirect back end ``` To pass arguments with a redirect, either add them to the query: ruby redirect to(/bar?sum=42) Or use a session: ```ruby enable :sessions get /foo do session[:secret] = foo redirect to(/bar) end get /bar do session[:secret] end ``` Cache Control Setting your headers correctly is the foundation for proper HTTP caching. You can easily set the Cache-Control header like this: ruby get / do cache_control :public "cache it!" end Pro tip: Set up caching in a before filter: ruby before do cache_control :public, :must_revalidate, :max_age => 60 end If you are using the expires helper to set the corresponding header, Cache-Control will be set automatically for you: ruby before do expires 500, :public, :must_revalidate end To properly use caches, you should consider using etag or last_modified. It is recommended to call those helpers before doing any heavy lifting, as they will immediately flush a response if the client already has the current version in its cache: ruby get "/article/:id" do @article = Article.find params[id] last_modified @article.updated_at etag @article.sha1 erb :article end It is also possible to use a weak ETag: ruby etag @article.sha1, :weak These helpers will not do any caching for you, but rather feed the necessary information to your cache. If you are looking for a quick reverse-proxy caching solution, try rack-cache: ```ruby require "rack/cache" require "sinatra" use Rack::Cache get / do cache_control :public, :max_age => 36000 sleep 5 "hello" end ``` Use the :static_cache_control setting (see below) to add Cache-Control header info to static files. According to RFC 2616, your application should behave differently if the If-Match or If-None-Match header is set to *, depending on whether the resource requested is already in existence. Sinatra assumes resources for safe (like get) and idempotent (like put) requests are already in existence, whereas other resources (for instance post requests) are treated as new resources. You can change this behavior by passing in a :new_resource option: ruby get /create do etag , :new_resource => true Article.create erb :new_article end If you still want to use a weak ETag, pass in a :kind option: ruby etag , :new_resource => true, :kind => :weak Sending Files To return the contents of a file as the response, you can use the send_file helper method: ruby get / do send_file foo.png end It also takes options: ruby send_file foo.png, :type => :jpg The options are: filename File name to be used in the response, defaults to the real file name. last_modified Value for Last-Modified header, defaults to the files mtime. type Value for Content-Type header, guessed from the file extension if missing. disposition Value for Content-Disposition header, possible values: nil (default), :attachment and :inline length Value for Content-Length header, defaults to file size. status Status code to be sent. Useful when sending a static file as an error page. If supported by the Rack handler, other means than streaming from the Ruby process will be used. If you use this helper method, Sinatra will automatically handle range requests. Accessing the Request Object The incoming request object can be accessed from request level (filter, routes, error handlers) through the request method: ```ruby app running on http://example.com/example get /foo do t = %w[text/css text/html application/javascript] request.accept # [text/html, /] request.accept? text/xml # true request.preferred_type(t) # text/html request.body # request body sent by the client (see below) request.scheme # "http" request.script_name # "/example" request.path_info # "/foo" request.port # 80 request.request_method # "GET" request.query_string # "" request.content_length # length of request.body request.media_type # media type of request.body request.host # "example.com" request.get? # true (similar methods for other verbs) request.form_data? # false request["some_param"] # value of some_param parameter. [] is a shortcut to the params hash. request.referrer # the referrer of the client or / request.user_agent # user agent (used by :agent condition) request.cookies # hash of browser cookies request.xhr? # is this an ajax request? request.url # "http://example.com/example/foo" request.path # "/example/foo" request.ip # client IP address request.secure? # false (would be true over ssl) request.forwarded? # true (if running behind a reverse proxy) request.env # raw env hash handed in by Rack end ``` Some options, like script_name or path_info, can also be written: ```ruby before { request.path_info = "/" } get "/" do "all requests end up here" end ``` The request.body is an IO or StringIO object: ruby post "/api" do request.body.rewind # in case someone already read it data = JSON.parse request.body.read "Hello #{data[name]}!" end Attachments You can use the attachment helper to tell the browser the response should be stored on disk rather than displayed in the browser: ruby get / do attachment "store it!" end You can also pass it a file name: ruby get / do attachment "info.txt" "store it!" end Dealing with Date and Time Sinatra offers a time_for helper method that generates a Time object from the given value. It is also able to convert DateTime, Date and similar classes: ruby get / do pass if Time.now > time_for(Dec 23, 2016) "still time" end This method is used internally by expires, last_modified and akin. You can therefore easily extend the behavior of those methods by overriding time_for in your application: ```ruby helpers do def time_for(value) case value when :yesterday then Time.now - 246060 when :tomorrow then Time.now + 246060 else super end end end get / do last_modified :yesterday expires :tomorrow "hello" end ``` Looking Up Template Files The find_template helper is used to find template files for rendering: ruby find_template settings.views, foo, Tilt[:haml] do |file| puts "could be #{file}" end This is not really useful. But it is useful that you can actually override this method to hook in your own lookup mechanism. For instance, if you want to be able to use more than one view directory: ```ruby set :views, [views, templates] helpers do def find_template(views, name, engine, &block) Array(views).each { |v| super(v, name, engine, &block) } end end ``` Another example would be using different directories for different engines: ```ruby set :views, :sass => views/sass, :haml => templates, :default => views helpers do def find_template(views, name, engine, &block) _, folder = views.detect { |k,v| engine == Tilt[k] } folder ||= views[:default] super(folder, name, engine, &block) end end ``` You can also easily wrap this up in an extension and share with others! Note that find_template does not check if the file really exists but rather calls the given block for all possible paths. This is not a performance issue, since render will use break as soon as a file is found. Also, template locations (and content) will be cached if you are not running in development mode. You should keep that in mind if you write a really crazy method. Configuration Run once, at startup, in any environment: ```ruby configure do # setting one option set :option, value # setting multiple options set :a => 1, :b => 2 # same as set :option, true enable :option # same as set :option, false disable :option # you can also have dynamic settings with blocks set(:css_dir) { File.join(views, css) } end ``` Run only when the environment (APP_ENV environment variable) is set to :production: ruby configure :production do ... end Run when the environment is set to either :production or :test: ruby configure :production, :test do ... end You can access those options via settings: ```ruby configure do set :foo, bar end get / do settings.foo? # => true settings.foo # => bar ... end ``` Configuring attack protection Sinatra is using Rack::Protection to defend your application against common, opportunistic attacks. You can easily disable this behavior (which will open up your application to tons of common vulnerabilities): ruby disable :protection To skip a single defense layer, set protection to an options hash: ruby set :protection, :except => :path_traversal You can also hand in an array in order to disable a list of protections: ruby set :protection, :except => [:path_traversal, :session_hijacking] By default, Sinatra will only set up session based protection if :sessions have been enabled. See Using Sessions. Sometimes you may want to set up sessions "outside" of the Sinatra app, such as in the config.ru or with a separate Rack::Builder instance. In that case you can still set up session based protection by passing the :session option: ruby set :protection, :session => true Available Settings absolute_redirects If disabled, Sinatra will allow relative redirects, however, Sinatra will no longer conform with RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1), which only allows absolute redirects. Enable if your app is running behind a reverse proxy that has not been set up properly. Note that the url helper will still produce absolute URLs, unless you pass in false as the second parameter. Disabled by default. add_charset Mime types the content_type helper will automatically add the charset info to. You should add to it rather than overriding this option: settings.add_charset << "application/foobar" app_file Path to the main application file, used to detect project root, views and public folder and inline templates. bind IP address to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0 or localhost if your `environment` is set to development). Only used for built-in server. default_encoding Encoding to assume if unknown (defaults to "utf-8"). dump_errors Display errors in the log. environment Current environment. Defaults to ENV[APP_ENV], or "development" if not available. logging Use the logger. lock Places a lock around every request, only running processing on request per Ruby process concurrently. Enabled if your app is not thread-safe. Disabled by default. method_override Use _method magic to allow put/delete forms in browsers that dont support it. mustermann_opts A default hash of options to pass to Mustermann.new when compiling routing paths. port Port to listen on. Only used for built-in server. prefixed_redirects Whether or not to insert request.script_name into redirects if no absolute path is given. That way redirect /foo would behave like redirect to(/foo). Disabled by default. protection Whether or not to enable web attack protections. See protection section above. public_dir Alias for public_folder. See below. public_folder Path to the folder public files are served from. Only used if static file serving is enabled (see static setting below). Inferred from app_file setting if not set. quiet Disables logs generated by Sinatras start and stop commands. false by default. reload_templates Whether or not to reload templates between requests. Enabled in development mode. root Path to project root folder. Inferred from app_file setting if not set. raise_errors Raise exceptions (will stop application). Enabled by default when environment is set to "test", disabled otherwise. run If enabled, Sinatra will handle starting the web server. Do not enable if using rackup or other means. running Is the built-in server running now? Do not change this setting! server Server or list of servers to use for built-in server. Order indicates priority, default depends on Ruby implementation. server_settings If you are using a WEBrick web server, presumably for your development environment, you can pass a hash of options to server_settings, such as SSLEnable or SSLVerifyClient. However, web servers such as Puma and Thin do not support this, so you can set server_settings by defining it as a method when you call configure. sessions Enable cookie-based sessions support using Rack::Session::Cookie. See Using Sessions section for more information. session_store The Rack session middleware used. Defaults to Rack::Session::Cookie. See Using Sessions section for more information. show_exceptions Show a stack trace in the browser when an exception happens. Enabled by default when environment is set to "development", disabled otherwise. Can also be set to :after_handler to trigger app-specified error handling before showing a stack trace in the browser. static Whether Sinatra should handle serving static files. Disable when using a server able to do this on its own. Disabling will boost performance. Enabled by default in classic style, disabled for modular apps. static_cache_control When Sinatra is serving static files, set this to add Cache-Control headers to the responses. Uses the cache_control helper. Disabled by default. Use an explicit array when setting multiple values: set :static_cache_control, [:public, :max_age => 300] threaded If set to true, will tell Thin to use EventMachine.defer for processing the request. traps Whether Sinatra should handle system signals. views Path to the views folder. Inferred from app_file setting if not set. x_cascade Whether or not to set the X-Cascade header if no route matches. Defaults to true. Environments There are three predefined environments: "development", "production" and "test". Environments can be set through the APP_ENV environment variable. The default value is "development". In the "development" environment all templates are reloaded between requests, and special not_found and error handlers display stack traces in your browser. In the "production" and "test" environments, templates are cached by default. To run different environments, set the APP_ENV environment variable: shell APP_ENV=production ruby my_app.rb You can use predefined methods: development?, test? and production? to check the current environment setting: ruby get / do if settings.development? "development!" else "not development!" end end Error Handling Error handlers run within the same context as routes and before filters, which means you get all the goodies it has to offer, like haml, erb, halt, etc. Not Found When a Sinatra::NotFound exception is raised, or the responses status code is 404, the not_found handler is invoked: ruby not_found do This is nowhere to be found. end Error The error handler is invoked any time an exception is raised from a route block or a filter. But note in development it will only run if you set the show exceptions option to :after_handler: ruby set :show_exceptions, :after_handler The exception object can be obtained from the sinatra.error Rack variable: ruby error do Sorry there was a nasty error - + env[sinatra.error].message end Custom errors: ruby error MyCustomError do So what happened was... + env[sinatra.error].message end Then, if this happens: ruby get / do raise MyCustomError, something bad end You get this: So what happened was... something bad Alternatively, you can install an error handler for a status code: ```ruby error 403 do Access forbidden end get /secret do 403 end ``` Or a range: ruby error 400..510 do Boom end Sinatra installs special not_found and error handlers when running under the development environment to display nice stack traces and additional debugging information in your browser. Rack Middleware Sinatra rides on Rack, a minimal standard interface for Ruby web frameworks. One of Racks most interesting capabilities for application developers is support for "middleware" -- components that sit between the server and your application monitoring and/or manipulating the HTTP request/response to provide various types of common functionality. Sinatra makes building Rack middleware pipelines a cinch via a top-level use method: ```ruby require sinatra require my_custom_middleware use Rack::Lint use MyCustomMiddleware get /hello do Hello World end ``` The semantics of use are identical to those defined for the Rack::Builder DSL (most frequently used from rackup files). For example, the use method accepts multiple/variable args as well as blocks: ruby use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password| username == admin && password == secret end Rack is distributed with a variety of standard middleware for logging, debugging, URL routing, authentication, and session handling. Sinatra uses many of these components automatically based on configuration so you typically dont have to use them explicitly. You can find useful middleware in rack, rack-contrib, or in the Rack wiki. Testing Sinatra tests can be written using any Rack-based testing library or framework. Rack::Test is recommended: ```ruby require my_sinatra_app require minitest/autorun require rack/test class MyAppTest < Minitest::Test include Rack::Test::Methods def app Sinatra::Application end def test_my_default get / assert_equal Hello World!, last_response.body end def test_with_params get /meet, :name => Frank assert_equal Hello Frank!, last_response.body end def test_with_user_agent get /, {}, HTTP_USER_AGENT => Songbird assert_equal "Youre using Songbird!", last_response.body end end ``` Note: If you are using Sinatra in the modular style, replace Sinatra::Application above with the class name of your app. Sinatra::Base - Middleware, Libraries, and Modular Apps Defining your app at the top-level works well for micro-apps but has considerable drawbacks when building reusable components such as Rack middleware, Rails metal, simple libraries with a server component, or even Sinatra extensions. The top-level assumes a micro-app style configuration (e.g., a single application file, ./public and ./views directories, logging, exception detail page, etc.). Thats where Sinatra::Base comes into play: ```ruby require sinatra/base class MyApp < Sinatra::Base set :sessions, true set :foo, bar get / do Hello world! end end ``` The methods available to Sinatra::Base subclasses are exactly the same as those available via the top-level DSL. Most top-level apps can be converted to Sinatra::Base components with two modifications: Your file should require sinatra/base instead of sinatra; otherwise, all of Sinatras DSL methods are imported into the main namespace. Put your apps routes, error handlers, filters, and options in a subclass of Sinatra::Base. Sinatra::Base is a blank slate. Most options are disabled by default, including the built-in server. See Configuring Settings for details on available options and their behavior. If you want behavior more similar to when you define your app at the top level (also known as Classic style), you can subclass Sinatra::Application: ```ruby require sinatra/base class MyApp < Sinatra::Application get / do Hello world! end end ``` Modular vs. Classic Style Contrary to common belief, there is nothing wrong with the classic style. If it suits your application, you do not have to switch to a modular application. The main disadvantage of using the classic style rather than the modular style is that you will only have one Sinatra application per Ruby process. If you plan to use more than one, switch to the modular style. There is no reason you cannot mix the modular and the classic styles. If switching from one style to the other, you should be aware of slightly different default settings: Setting Classic Modular Modular app_file file loading sinatra file subclassing Sinatra::Base file subclassing Sinatra::Application run $0 == app_file false false logging true false true method_override true false true inline_templates true false true static true File.exist?(public_folder) true Serving a Modular Application There are two common options for starting a modular app, actively starting with run!: ```ruby my_app.rb require sinatra/base class MyApp < Sinatra::Base # ... app code here ... # start the server if ruby file executed directly run! if app_file == $0 end ``` Start with: shell ruby my_app.rb Or with a config.ru file, which allows using any Rack handler: ```ruby config.ru (run with rackup) require ./my_app run MyApp ``` Run: shell rackup -p 4567 Using a Classic Style Application with a config.ru Write your app file: ```ruby app.rb require sinatra get / do Hello world! end ``` And a corresponding config.ru: ruby require ./app run Sinatra::Application When to use a config.ru? A config.ru file is recommended if: You want to deploy with a different Rack handler (Passenger, Unicorn, Heroku, ...). You want to use more than one subclass of Sinatra::Base. You want to use Sinatra only for middleware, and not as an endpoint. There is no need to switch to a config.ru simply because you switched to the modular style, and you dont have to use the modular style for running with a config.ru. Using Sinatra as Middleware Not only is Sinatra able to use other Rack middleware, any Sinatra application can in turn be added in front of any Rack endpoint as middleware itself. This endpoint could be another Sinatra application, or any other Rack-based application (Rails/Hanami/Roda/...): ```ruby require sinatra/base class LoginScreen < Sinatra::Base enable :sessions get(/login) { haml :login } post(/login) do if params[name] == admin && params[password] == admin session[user_name] = params[name] else redirect /login end end end class MyApp < Sinatra::Base # middleware will run before filters use LoginScreen before do unless session[user_name] halt "Access denied, please login." end end get(/) { "Hello #{session[user_name]}." } end ``` Dynamic Application Creation Sometimes you want to create new applications at runtime without having to assign them to a constant. You can do this with Sinatra.new: ruby require sinatra/base my_app = Sinatra.new { get(/) { "hi" } } my_app.run! It takes the application to inherit from as an optional argument: ```ruby config.ru (run with rackup) require sinatra/base controller = Sinatra.new do enable :logging helpers MyHelpers end map(/a) do run Sinatra.new(controller) { get(/) { a } } end map(/b) do run Sinatra.new(controller) { get(/) { b } } end ``` This is especially useful for testing Sinatra extensions or using Sinatra in your own library. This also makes using Sinatra as middleware extremely easy: ```ruby require sinatra/base use Sinatra do get(/) { ... } end run RailsProject::Application ``` Scopes and Binding The scope you are currently in determines what methods and variables are available. Application/Class Scope Every Sinatra application corresponds to a subclass of Sinatra::Base. If you are using the top-level DSL (require sinatra), then this class is Sinatra::Application, otherwise it is the subclass you created explicitly. At class level you have methods like get or before, but you cannot access the request or session objects, as there is only a single application class for all requests. Options created via set are methods at class level: ```ruby class MyApp < Sinatra::Base # Hey, Im in the application scope! set :foo, 42 foo # => 42 get /foo do # Hey, Im no longer in the application scope! end end ``` You have the application scope binding inside: Your application class body Methods defined by extensions The block passed to helpers Procs/blocks used as value for set The block passed to Sinatra.new You can reach the scope object (the class) like this: Via the object passed to configure blocks (configure { |c| ... }) settings from within the request scope Request/Instance Scope For every incoming request, a new instance of your application class is created, and all handler blocks run in that scope. From within this scope you can access the request and session objects or call rendering methods like erb or haml. You can access the application scope from within the request scope via the settings helper: ```ruby class MyApp < Sinatra::Base # Hey, Im in the application scope! get /define_route/:name do # Request scope for /define_route/:name @value = 42 settings.get("/#{params[name]}") do # Request scope for "/#{params[name]}" @value # => nil (not the same request) end "Route defined!" end end ``` You have the request scope binding inside: get, head, post, put, delete, options, patch, link and unlink blocks before and after filters helper methods templates/views Delegation Scope The delegation scope just forwards methods to the class scope. However, it does not behave exactly like the class scope, as you do not have the class binding. Only methods explicitly marked for delegation are available, and you do not share variables/state with the class scope (read: you have a different self). You can explicitly add method delegations by calling Sinatra::Delegator.delegate :method_name. You have the delegate scope binding inside: The top level binding, if you did require "sinatra" An object extended with the Sinatra::Delegator mixin Have a look at the code for yourself: heres the Sinatra::Delegator mixin being extending the main object. Command Line Sinatra applications can be run directly: shell ruby myapp.rb [-h] [-x] [-q] [-e ENVIRONMENT] [-p PORT] [-o HOST] [-s HANDLER] Options are: -h # help -p # set the port (default is 4567) -o # set the host (default is 0.0.0.0) -e # set the environment (default is development) -s # specify rack server/handler (default is thin) -q # turn on quiet mode for server (default is off) -x # turn on the mutex lock (default is off) Multi-threading Paraphrasing from this StackOverflow answer by Konstantin Sinatra doesnt impose any concurrency model, but leaves that to the underlying Rack handler (server) like Thin, Puma or WEBrick. Sinatra itself is thread-safe, so there wont be any problem if the Rack handler uses a threaded model of concurrency. This would mean that when starting the server, youd have to specify the correct invocation method for the specific Rack handler. The following example is a demonstration of how to start a multi-threaded Thin server: ```ruby app.rb require sinatra/base class App < Sinatra::Base get / do "Hello, World" end end App.run! ``` To start the server, the command would be: shell thin --threaded start Requirement The following Ruby versions are officially supported: Ruby 2.2 2.2 is fully supported and recommended. There are currently no plans to drop official support for it. Rubinius Rubinius is officially supported (Rubinius >= 2.x). It is recommended to gem install puma. JRuby The latest stable release of JRuby is officially supported. It is not recommended to use C extensions with JRuby. It is recommended to gem install trinidad. Versions of Ruby prior to 2.2.2 are no longer supported as of Sinatra 2.0. We also keep an eye on upcoming Ruby versions. The following Ruby implementations are not officially supported but still are known to run Sinatra: Older versions of JRuby and Rubinius Ruby Enterprise Edition MacRuby, Maglev, IronRuby Ruby 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 (but we do recommend against using those) Not being officially supported means if things only break there and not on a supported platform, we assume its not our issue but theirs. We also run our CI against ruby-head (future releases of MRI), but we cant guarantee anything, since it is constantly moving. Expect upcoming 2.x releases to be fully supported. Sinatra should work on any operating system supported by the chosen Ruby implementation. If you run MacRuby, you should gem install control_tower. Sinatra currently doesnt run on Cardinal, SmallRuby, BlueRuby or any Ruby version prior to 2.2. The Bleeding Edge If you would like to use Sinatras latest bleeding-edge code, feel free to run your application against the master branch, it should be rather stable. We also push out prerelease gems from time to time, so you can do a shell gem install sinatra --pre to get some of the latest features. With Bundler If you want to run your application with the latest Sinatra, using Bundler is the recommended way. First, install bundler, if you havent: shell gem install bundler Then, in your project directory, create a Gemfile: ```ruby source https://rubygems.org gem sinatra, :github => sinatra/sinatra other dependencies gem haml # for instance, if you use haml ``` Note that you will have to list all your applications dependencies in the Gemfile. Sinatras direct dependencies (Rack and Tilt) will, however, be automatically fetched and added by Bundler. Now you can run your app like this: shell bundle exec ruby myapp.rb Versioning Sinatra follows Semantic Versioning, both SemVer and SemVerTag.
